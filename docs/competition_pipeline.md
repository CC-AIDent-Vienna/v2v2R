# ToothFairy4 competition container — pipeline

One CBCT volume in, one radiology report out. Grand Challenge starts a **fresh
container for every case** and gives it **15 minutes**.

## Who does what

| | owner | produces |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Segmentation** | *(segmentation)* | `mask.nii.gz` — per-tooth FDI labels + jaw structures |
| **B. Facts** | *(segmentation)* | `facts.json` — which FDI numbers are present/absent |
| **B′. Facts audit** | *(VQA)* | an audited **copy** of `facts.json`, corrected against the mask |
| **C. Report** | *(VQA)* | rendered images → VLM reads → `report.txt` |

**vLLM belongs entirely to C.** B is the handover point: everything downstream
needs to know which teeth actually exist.

B′ is ours, not theirs. Both the mask and the facts arrive from the
segmentation component, so both exist on Grand Challenge and passing them is
the real input shape. But `facts.json` is extracted from a radiology *report*,
and a report describes the patient while the mask describes the acquisition —
so we audit what we are handed before any generator opens it. See
[The facts audit](#the-facts-audit).

                        3. post-process -> report.txt
```

**The point of 1a running first:** loading the model needs the GPU and no CPU;
segmentation and rendering need CPU and (mostly) no GPU. Run them at the same
time and one hides inside the other. Run them in sequence and you pay for both.

## The facts audit

`code/pipeline/segmentation/audit_facts.py`, run by `competition_runner.py` as the phase
`facts:audit`, before any generator opens the facts file.

### Why it exists

`facts.json` is extracted from the radiology **report**; `mask.nii.gz` is the
**acquisition**. They disagree in one systematic, damaging way: when the
maxilla was never in the scan volume, the report still enumerates the upper
teeth — usually as *absent*, because they are absent from the picture the
radiologist had — and the extraction records that verbatim. Nothing downstream
can tell that apart from a genuinely edentulous maxilla.

S0002 is the worked example. Its mask holds 252 mm³ of maxilla — 0.5 % of the
segmentation, nothing at all in the render — and no maxillary tooth label
whatsoever, while its facts said `fov.maxilla: "partial"` and listed 11–28 as
absent. That produced the caption *"No maxillary tooth is present — the maxilla
is fully edentulous."* Every clause about the maxilla is false, and the last is
a clinical claim about anatomy nobody imaged.

### What it corrects

Both rules measure the mask with `create_3d_renders.mask_label_volumes` — the
same function the renderer captions from, so the audit and the caption can
never disagree. **Bone and teeth are judged separately**, because the mask
routinely has one without the other (P045 has zero maxillary bone and all
sixteen upper tooth labels, and its report says exactly that).

| | condition | effect |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | maxillary bone < `MIN_ARCH_BONE_MM3` | `fov.maxilla := "excluded"` — renders as *"maxilla not included"*, and is what schema v6.6's `maxilla_included` answers from |
| **B** | bone below threshold **and** no maxillary tooth label either | every maxillary FDI (11–28, plus 51–65 primary codes) removed from `teeth_present` / `teeth_absent` / `crowns` / `implants` / `ian_close_teeth` |

It also writes `bridge_arches`, which upstream has no key for at all.

### Why it cannot be skipped

Neither correction is something upstream could have made — both are statements
about the **acquisition**, and only the mask can make them:

- `fov.maxilla := "excluded"` is **never** set upstream; `extract_facts` writes
  `"partial"` or nothing. Absent-teeth reporting gates on exactly that field,
  and **12 of the 40 validate cases change** because of it.
- the fixed-bridge rule reads `bridge_arches`, a key upstream never emits.

### How it is wired, and why each choice

- **It runs first.** Every generator reads the facts file — it decides which
  teeth get outlined and what the captions say — so auditing after a render
  would mean rendering twice.
- **It is free.** ~2 s of CPU, entirely inside the ~200 s model-load shadow.
- **It works on a copy.** `audit_facts.py` rewrites in place, so the runner
  copies first and never mutates the input it was handed.
- **Failure is not fatal.** A failed audit logs `[WARN]` and the run continues
  on unaudited facts — they still describe the case, just less precisely.
- **Its stdout is printed, not captured.** This is the one stage that rewrites
  an input the rest of the run treats as given, and silence is exactly how
  *"the FOV correction never fired"* stays invisible for a whole run.

## Timings we have measured

On an A100. An A10G is ~2.5× slower on memory bandwidth, so treat these as a
floor, not a promise.

| step | time | notes |
|---|---|---|
| vLLM startup on a 24 GiB card (A30) | **159 s** | measured, cold cache: engine init 116 s of it |
| vLLM startup on A100, warm compile cache | ~28 s | the same work with the kernels already compiled |
| render all images | 71 s | panoramic 27 s ∥ 3D 52 s ∥ sinus 9 s, then crops 18 s |
| inference, 38 calls | 96 s | batched; concurrency ~10, auto-sized from the KV pool |
| post-process + report | < 5 s | pure string templates, no model |
| segmentation | 134 s | measured in the real container (103 s of it GPU) |
| fact extraction | 30 s | CPU |

### ⚠ The single biggest risk: the torch.compile cache

vLLM compiles CUDA kernels on first start and caches them. Cached, startup is
~28 s. Uncached, it is ~200 s — **every case**, because the container is fresh
every time. On a 900-second budget that is 20% of everything, spent doing the
same work over and over.

**Fix: run the model once while building the image, and ship the resulting cache
inside it.** Set `VLLM_CACHE_ROOT` to a path inside the image, start the server
once during the build, let it finish loading, stop it. The compiled kernels are
then baked in.

Grand Challenge also forbids writing to `/tmp` at runtime, so the cache must not
default there.

## Two things measured on 2026-08-13 that change the ordering

### 1. vLLM should start when segmentation releases the GPU, not at the end

In the production log the order was: segment (134 s) → facts (30 s) → render
(78 s) → **then** start vLLM, 248 s in. Startup is the longest single phase, and
it spent that whole time not running.

It cannot start at t=0 either: segmentation's forward pass is 103 s **on the
GPU**, and loading an 11 GiB model beside it on a 24 GiB card risks running out
of memory. But facts and rendering are pure CPU — 108 s of them:

```
segment 134 s (GPU) ──┬── START vLLM here
                      ├── facts 30 s ─ render 78 s   (CPU, 108 s)
                      └── vLLM loads underneath      ~159 s
```

Measured on the A30, one case end to end, every call succeeding:

```
vLLM startup   190 s  ####################       (cold compile cache)
images          71 s  #######                     entirely hidden inside it
inference       96 s                    ##########
post + report  0.1 s
TOTAL          287 s  = 32% of the 900 s budget
```

Image generation costs **nothing** on the critical path — it finishes 119 s
before the server is ready. With the compile cache baked in, startup drops by
roughly 130 s and the total lands near 160 s (18%).

### 2. Suspect the offline environment before suspecting compute

`--enforce-eager` already skips CUDA-graph capture, so a >10 minute startup is
unlikely to be compilation. With no network, an HF-hub metadata lookup or a
vLLM usage-stats POST does not fail fast — it **blocks until timeout**. Set:

```
HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1  TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1  VLLM_NO_USAGE_STATS=1  DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```

### ⚠ Do not shorten `--max-model-len`

32768 is correct and must stay. The context has to hold the prompt **and** the
reply, and the whole-jaw calls ask for 8192 output tokens on top of a ~12.5 k
character prompt. At `--max-model-len 8192` every one of those calls fails with
a 400 — but the per-tooth calls still succeed, so **the run exits 0 and writes a
report**, just with the whole-jaw findings silently missing. We hit exactly this
in testing; it does not look like a failure.

## Container requirements

Base must have **CUDA 12.8** — the platform runs driver 570, and CUDA 13 needs
driver 580+. A cu130 image will not start at all.

| | version | why |
|---|---|---|
| NVIDIA driver (theirs) | 570 | fixed by Grand Challenge |
| CUDA | **12.8** | anything 12.x works on driver 570; 13.x does not |
| vLLM | **0.19.0** | newest release still on CUDA 12.8 *and* supporting Qwen3.5 |
| torch | 2.10.0+cu128 | pulled in by vLLM 0.19.0 |

### Two environments in one image

Segmentation and VQA both want torch, and probably not the same version. To
avoid a conflict that only shows up at runtime, each half gets its own venv:

```dockerfile
# segmentation
RUN python3 -m venv /opt/seg   && /opt/seg/bin/pip   install -r seg_requirements.txt
# VQA + vLLM
RUN python3 -m venv /opt/vqa   && /opt/vqa/bin/pip   install -r env/competition_requirements.txt
```

Each step is then run with its own interpreter (`/opt/seg/bin/python …`,
`/opt/vqa/bin/python …`). They never import each other — the handover is
`mask.nii.gz` and `facts.json` on disk — so they do not need to share anything.

Cost: two copies of torch, roughly +5 GB of image. Worth it against a version
conflict discovered on the leaderboard.

## Hardware budget

| | limit |
|---|---|
| GPU | A10G, 24 GiB VRAM (or T4 16 GiB — see below) |
| RAM | 32 GiB |
| time | **15 min per case** |
| network | **none** — everything baked into the image |
| user | non-root; `/input` read-only; `/tmp` must be empty |

Model footprint: `Qwen3.5-9B-AWQ` is **11.2 GiB** of weights, leaving ~12 GiB of
KV cache on a 24 GiB card. It will **not** work on a T4: the 4-bit kernels
(Marlin) need compute capability 8.0+, and a T4 is 7.5.

## Interface between the halves

```
/input/                       given by Grand Challenge
  <case>.nii.gz               the CBCT volume

  A/B produce:
    mask.nii.gz               FDI-labelled segmentation
    facts.json                {"structured": {"teeth_present": [11,12,...],
                                              "teeth_absent":  [16,25,...]}}

  B' produces (ours, a copy -- the input is never mutated):
    facts.audited.json        + fov.maxilla ("excluded" when the mask says so)
                              + bridge_arches
                              - maxillary FDIs, when neither bone nor teeth
                                are in the volume

  C produces:
/output/
  report.txt                  the radiology report
```

`facts.json` needs `teeth_present` above all: the renderer draws and labels only
those teeth, so a segmentation false positive never becomes a tooth in the
report. Everything else in the file is optional **as input** — but two fields
the generators depend on are not optional as *output*, and neither is supplied
upstream: `fov.maxilla: "excluded"` and `bridge_arches`. Both are written by
the audit, which is why it is not a validation pass that can be turned off.

## Open questions

1. **How long does segmentation take, and does it use the GPU?** If it does, it
   competes with vLLM's load instead of hiding under it, and the two can no
   longer start together.
2. ~~**Is `facts.json` derived from the mask?**~~ **Partly answered.** The mask
   and the facts both come from the segmentation component — the pools
   `dataset/source/{predictions,facts_all_622_cases_new}` — so both exist on
   Grand Challenge and passing both is the real input shape, not a research
   convenience. What is *not* answered is how tightly the facts track the mask,
   and the audit exists because the answer is "not tightly enough": the two
   corrections it makes are ones only the mask can support, and one of them
   changes 12 of 40 validate cases. Treat the facts as a claim to be checked,
   not as a derived view of the segmentation.
3. **Peak RAM of segmentation + rendering together.** The cap is 32 GiB for the
   whole container, and both halves load the volume.
