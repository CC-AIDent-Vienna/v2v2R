code/eval/survey_facts.py

Fact-level survey: prediction and summary scored against the GENERATED ground
truth (`dataset/{split}/outputs/ground_truth/{case}*_gt.json`), not against the
hand-coded REPORT_GT table in survey_findings.py.

WHY A SECOND SURVEY RATHER THAN AN EDIT
───────────────────────────────────────
survey_findings.py scores against REPORT_GT, a hand-curated {case: {category:
[fdi]}} table covering five categories, plus the facts file for absent teeth.
That last row is why its overview says "vs segmentation mask": no report
enumerates every position, so absence had to be scored against the mask, which
is not always right.

parse_reports_to_gt.py now emits ground truth in the SAME SHAPE as a prediction
-- {case_id, global, teeth} -- which changes what is possible. Absence, atrophy,
implants, bridges and the per-tooth findings all live in that file as ordinary
fields, so they can be scored directly and no axis has to fall back to the mask.

It is a separate module because swapping the GT source underneath
survey_findings.py would silently invalidate its own diff history: every
survey/survey_<ts>.txt it has written is mask-scored on that row, and a
GT-scored number in the same column would compare against a different question.

WHAT IT REUSES, AND WHY THAT MATTERS
────────────────────────────────────
Nothing here re-derives how a claim is read out of a prediction. The extractors
in survey_findings.py (pred_claims, pred_absent, pred_prosthetics, pred_anatomy
and their summary_* counterparts) already encode the awkward parts -- the
pre-v6.4 fallbacks, the ARCH_VALUE folding, the composite's restoration
priority, the rule that an arch whose pattern is "unknown" is sixteen UNREAD
positions rather than sixteen present teeth. Re-implementing any of that would
drift the moment the schema moves.

The ground truth is read with the PREDICTION extractors, not with separate ones.
That is the whole payoff of parse_reports_to_gt.py emitting prediction shape: a
GT file and a prediction file are the same kind of object, so `pred_claims(gt)`
and `pred_claims(pred)` are comparable by construction, with zero case-specific
logic on either side.

MULTI-READER POLICY
───────────────────
A case may have several reader files (A008_gt.json, F067_2_gt.json, ...). The
FIRST ALPHABETICALLY is used, matching official_ranking.py and the challenge's
own tarball convention, so this survey and the leaderboard are looking at the
same label.
