build_sft_targets.py -- tooth-composite calls + generated GT -> SFT rows.

docs/vision_sft_plan.md §3. One row per tooth call: the exact prompt the pipeline
would send, the answer the reference reports support, and a per-field decision
about which of those fields may contribute loss.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO
──────────────────────────
It does not tokenize, and it does not store the rendered prompt. A row carries
the qa_pairs.jsonl call entry verbatim (`images`, `captions`, `questions`) and
train_vision_lora.py's collator renders it at load time through the SAME
imported function this file validates it with. Two reasons, and the second is
the important one:

  * size -- build_captioned_image_blocks() inlines each PNG as a base64 data
    URI, ~0.7 MB per call, ~2 GB over the pool;
  * parity -- §3.4 requires the training prompt to be byte-identical to the
    serving prompt. Storing a rendered copy makes that a fact about the day
    this file ran. Storing the INPUTS and calling
    run_vqa_inference.build_call_prompt() on both sides makes it true by
    construction, and the token-id diff against vLLM /tokenize then has one
    thing left to check rather than two.

THE MASK -- the reasons a field is not supervised
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Field-level, not token-level: this file says WHICH fields may contribute loss,
the collator turns that into -100 spans. Every exclusion has a number behind it
in the plan, and they are counted separately in the audit so a mask that
swallows a field can be seen rather than inferred.

  unstated    the tooth is in `_derivation[arch].unstated` -- the report never
              placed a tooth at that position at all (~45% of training slots).
  null        the GT value is null. After 51154c1 this is where absent-tooth
              positions land: a report that says 16 is gone says nothing about
              whether 16 is carious, so those fields are null, not false.
              Same word survey_facts.py and evaluate_predictions.py already
              score by, so loss and metric read one definition (§3.2).
  gated       filling_quality where morphology.with_endo is not true. The
              schema gates the fact; supervising it anyway teaches the model to
              answer a question it was told not to ask.
  refused     with_root_fracture (4 positives in 4 cases) and
              furcation_involvement (0 positives in 1,785 slots). Refused on
              COUNT, not on inter-reader agreement -- see the note below
              DEFAULT_REFUSED for why a low Jaccard is a coverage statistic
              and not a reason to drop a field. They stay in the OUTPUT SHAPE
              so the decoded object is still schema-valid; they just carry no
              gradient.
  evidence    visual_evidence that the STUDENT could not confirm, plus every
              empty string. §3.3: the prose comes from a teacher shown the
              image and the already-established answer, so it is supervised
              only where check_evidence_perceivable.py kept it -- training the
              model to name cues it cannot resolve would manufacture the
              over-calling the experiment exists to remove. Prose that fails
              the screen STAYS in the target, so the decision fields are
              conditioned on it exactly as at inference; it just carries no
              gradient. --evidence-weight 0 masks all of it.
  capped      §3.5's 6:1 rule. A supervised boolean whose negatives outnumber
              its positives by more than --neg-cap has the surplus negatives
              masked, seeded, down to that ratio -- because a ~92%-negative
              boolean under token CE in a 248,320-vocab will learn to emit
              `false`, which is arm 0 wearing a costume (R1). Masked rather
              than dropped: see apply_negative_cap() for why dropping calls
              cannot do this.

SPLIT SAFETY
────────────
Plan §0: nothing from dataset/validate may enter training. Enforced here at
load time, by reading the validate directory rather than trusting the case
list, and the count refused is printed. A case list is a convention; this is
a check.

# A LOW INTER-READER JACCARD IS A COVERAGE NUMBER, NOT A CONTRADICTION NUMBER.

# This is the correction that rebuilt this list (2026-08-13), and it matters
# because the whole refusal set was derived from the wrong statistic.
#
# Radiology reports state findings by exception. Reader A writes "post and core
# on 16"; reader B writes about the sinus and never mentions 16 at all. The
# pairwise Jaccard of their post_and_core sets is 0 -- and nothing is in
# dispute. Silence is not denial, which is the same rule this project already
# applies in two other places: parse_reports_to_gt.py nulls an absent tooth's
# fields rather than defaulting them, and verify_report_facts.combine() scores
# "one claims, one silent" as positive.
#
# So the union is the label: a tooth is positive if ANY reader claims it. The
# GT already does this -- consensus_report_facts() unions through _union_ints()
# -- and it was verified rather than assumed: over 341 multi-reader training
# cases the consensus file equals the union of its readers on 341/341 for

# ── Arch-level (global) calls ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The panoramic / 3D / sinus calls. Structurally the same job as a tooth call --
# one call, several facts, one constrained object -- but three things differ and
# each of them silently corrupts the target if reused from the tooth path.
#
# 1. FIELD NAMES ARE NOT UNIQUE ACROSS FACTS. `location` is free prose in
#    bone_quality_* ("from which tooth to which tooth") and an ENUM in
#    mandible_canal_* (lingual|buccal). PROSE_FIELDS matches bare names, so
#    reusing it would mask a scored enum. Arch keys are fact-qualified.
#
# 2. THERE IS NO `unstated` SIGNAL. For teeth, _derivation carries
#    present/absent/unstated per arch, so a tooth the report never mentions is
#    masked rather than trained as a negative. Nothing equivalent exists for
#    arch facts: parse_reports_to_gt.py's doctrine is "null means the report did
#    not say", and every field that HAS a neutral value is defaulted in code
#    ([] for lists, "none" for extent, partially_included for scope). So a
#    defaulted negative is indistinguishable from an observed one, and the only
#    honest defences are the two below.
#
# 3. SOME FIELDS ARE CONSTANT. Measured over the 144-case pool: sinus `scope` is
#    partially_included in 100% of cases -- not because sinuses are, but because
#    that is the literal fallback in _resolve_scope. A field where every example
#    says the same thing can only teach "emit that value", which is R1's
#    operating-point shift produced on purpose. Refused outright, on the same
#    grounds as DEFAULT_REFUSED.
#
#    THAT REASONING IS HALF RIGHT, AND ARM 5 MEASURED THE OTHER HALF (§8.2).
#    Refusing a constant does not leave it alone; it leaves it WITHOUT A
#    GRADIENT. Arm 5 trained with both sinus `scope` fields refused and the
#    baseline's 15/38 `fully_included` became 38/38 -- the one answer that is
#    always wrong, on a field whose truth is constant and therefore free to
#    anchor. "Not worth supervising" and "safe to leave unsupervised" are
#    different claims, and this file conflated them.
#
#    So ARCH_REFUSED is now a DEFAULT rather than a law: `--supervise` takes
#    dotted `fact_id.field` keys and removes them from it. Teaching the model
#    to emit the constant is exactly what is wanted here -- it is the correct
#    answer 100% of the time, and it costs one enum token per sinus call.

    Dropping calls cannot deliver that. The ratios differ wildly per field --
    is_remnant 73:1 against with_fillings 7.7:1 -- while a call carries every
    field at once, so dropping enough calls to fix is_remnant would delete most
    of with_fillings' positives with them. And dropping the all-negative calls
    specifically is worse than useless: a tooth with no findings is exactly what
    the model must learn to call normal, and removing those IS rebalancing
    toward positives, which the same paragraph forbids.

    So the negatives are masked instead, per field, down to cap x positives.
    Every call stays, every positive stays, the output shape is untouched, and
    only the loss changes -- which is the thing the 6:1 number was ever about.

    Seeded, because which negatives get masked must be reproducible across arms:
    arm 2 and arm 3 have to see the identical supervision or the contrast is not
    the contrast.

    Enums are left alone. The rule is stated for booleans, and "negative" is not
    defined for eruption_state.
