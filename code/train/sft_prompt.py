sft_prompt.py -- one SFT row -> the exact messages the pipeline would send.

docs/vision_sft_plan.md §3.4. This is the ONLY place that turns a row of
`sft_*.jsonl` into a chat conversation, and both sides of the experiment go
through it: check_prompt_parity.py compares its output against vLLM's own
tokenizer, and train_vision_lora.py's collator builds its training text from
it. Two copies of a prompt drift, and the drift is invisible -- the same
argument build_sft_targets.py makes for storing the call inputs rather than a
rendered prompt.

Nothing here formats a prompt itself. `run_vqa_inference.build_call_prompt` is
imported and called, so a schema edit that changes TOOTH_USER_TEMPLATE changes
training and serving together or not at all.

TWO THINGS IT DOES THAT THE PIPELINE DOES NOT, BOTH DELIBERATE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. **Image paths are resolved against the project root, not the working
   directory.** qa_pairs.jsonl stores them project-relative so one payload
   resolves on the host and at /project inside the container, and
   build_captioned_image_blocks() resolves them against `os.getcwd()`. That is
   correct for the pipeline, which runs from the project dir; it is a trap for
   anything else, and §3.3 records what the trap cost -- a teacher job with no
   working directory drafted 9,301 evidence strings having never loaded an
   image, because the resolver SILENTLY DROPS what it cannot find.

2. **A missing image raises.** `build_call_prompt` returns None and the
   pipeline logs a warning and skips the call, which is right at inference
   time: a case with one unrendered image should still produce a report. In
   training it is not right. A row whose image vanished would be trained as
   text-only against a target full of visual findings -- exactly the "assert
   what you cannot see" behaviour the experiment exists to remove. So
   `NoImage` propagates and the caller counts it.

# HOW THE SERVER ASSEMBLES A MULTIMODAL TURN -- MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED.
#
# vLLM resolves a "chat template content format" per server by inspecting the
# template's Jinja AST, and guesses `string` for Qwen3.5's. In that mode it does
# NOT render the content parts in order: _get_full_multimodal_text_prompt()
# hoists every image placeholder to the front of the turn and joins the text
# parts after it with "\n".
#
# So the caption this pipeline carefully puts BEFORE each image arrives after
# it, plus two newline tokens that are in no message anywhere. Job 555208
# measured it -- 6,126 host tokens against 6,128 served, diverging at the first
# token of the user turn -- and flatten_string_format() below reproduces the
# server's sequence exactly.
#
# THIS IS SET TO WHAT THE SERVER DOES, NOT TO WHAT THE PIPELINE INTENDS, and
# that is a deliberate decision (2026-08-14). The alternative -- serving with
# --chat-template-content-format openai -- restores the intended interleave,
# but it changes the prompt every run in this repo has been sent, so it
# invalidates the §5.0 baseline and every arm scored against it. Training
# against the prompt the model will actually receive costs nothing and keeps
# the whole result history comparable; making the caption-first design real is
# a separate, measured experiment (§1's rule for the prefill reorder).
#
# When that experiment is run, flip this to "openai" and re-baseline. Nothing
# else in the training path needs to know.
