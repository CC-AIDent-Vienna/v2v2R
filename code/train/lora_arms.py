"""The LoRA arm table, and the assertion that a config actually hit its targets.

Single source of truth for `docs/vision_sft_plan_stale.md` §2. `train_vision_lora.py`
imports ARMS from here and calls assert_arm() before it touches a GPU, so the
declared parameter count is checked in exactly one place.

WHY A COUNT IS ASSERTED AT ALL. The Qwen3.5 checkpoint names its submodules
`model.visual.*` and `model.language_model.*`. Qwen2-VL -- which every LoRA
recipe on the internet was written against -- names them `visual.*` and
`model.layers.*`. A copied `target_modules` therefore matches NOTHING, and
`get_peft_model()` reports 0 trainable parameters *without raising*: the job
starts, burns its wall-clock, writes an adapter, and the adapter is empty.
The count is the only cheap check that catches it.

The reverse trap is just as quiet. The checkpoint also carries an `mtp`
(multi-token-prediction) head whose submodules are ALSO called
`self_attn.{q,k,v,o}_proj`, so the obvious language regex
`.*self_attn\\.[qkvo]_proj` silently trains 9 blocks where arm 3 declares 8,
and the 2-vs-3 parameter match the whole experiment rests on is gone. Every
pattern here is anchored at `^` and matched with re.fullmatch by peft.

Counts are arithmetic from the safetensors shapes, not measurements:

  vision block x27  qkv [3456,1152] proj [1152,1152]
                    fc1 [4304,1152] fc2 [1152,4304]      -> 481,248 * r
  merger x1         fc1 [4304,4304]? -- see below         ->  17,920 * r
  language x8       q,k,v,o over hidden 2048 / kv 512     -> 245,760 * r
  gdn x24           in_proj_qkv [8192,4096] in_proj_z and
                    out_proj [4096,4096] each             -> 688,128 * r

A LoRA pair on [out,in] adds r*(in+out) parameters, so each figure above is
sum(in+out) over that group's matrices.

WHY NO ARM TOUCHES mlp.{down,up,gate}_proj, AND WHY THAT IS THE WHOLE FENCE.
Those 93 modules (layers 1-31) are the ONLY ones AWQ quantizes; its skip list
is ["visual", "linear_attn", "self_attn", "model.layers.0.", "mtp"], so every
group in the table above is bf16 and bit-identical between models/Qwen3.5-9B
and models/Qwen3.5-9B-AWQ. That identity is what lets an adapter trained here
merge into the deployed checkpoint exactly (merge_meta.json records it as
`bases_bit_identical`). A LoRA on the MLPs would be a delta fitted to
pre-quantisation weights with nothing to merge it into, so the fence is not a
matter of taste: train anything on the bf16 side of that list, nothing on the
other.

Run it standalone to settle the peft-x-transformers-5.9.0 question with no GPU:
