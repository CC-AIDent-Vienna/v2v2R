code/ground_truth/parse_reports_to_gt.py

Extracts structured ground truth from a radiologist's REFERENCE report
(free text) into the exact same JSON shape as {case_id}_pred.json --
{"case_id": ..., "global": {...}, "teeth": {...}} -- so
structured_findings_evaluation.py can compare prediction vs. ground truth field by
field with zero case-specific logic.

TWO STAGES, NOT ONE. THIS IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  stage 1  LLM  report text -> {case}[_{reader}]_report_facts.json
                a SMALL, report-shaped intermediate: the lists and enums a
                radiology report actually states ("teeth 32,33,... are
                present; 31,37,41,46,47 are absent", "endodontic treatment
                in 35 and 36, adequate", "canal runs lingually").
  stage 2  CODE report_facts -> {case}[_{reader}]_gt.json
                deterministic expansion into the full schema shape: all 16
                arch positions, all 32 per-tooth fact blocks, the wisdom
                tooth facts, the quadrant implant counts.

The previous version asked the LLM the schema's OWN questions directly --
34 calls per report (mandible + maxilla + one per FDI), each one re-reading
the same report through an image-shaped prompt. That failed three ways at
once, all visible in dataset/training/outputs/ground_truth/A020_gt.json:

  1. THE SCHEMA ASKS THE SAME FACT IN THREE PLACES, on purpose -- the VLM
     reads it off three different images and postprocess_pred.py votes.
     A report is ONE source, so asking it three times cannot add evidence;
     it can only add disagreement. A020's report says teeth 43, 44, 45 and
     48 are present, and the extraction returned dental_arch_findings_
     mandible.findings = {"43": "absent", "44": "absent", "45": "absent",
     "48": "absent"} while tooth_43_eruption / tooth_44_eruption / ... in
     the SAME file said "fully_erupted". Teeth 11 and 21 came back the
     other way round. Nothing downstream can repair a ground truth that
     contradicts itself. Here, presence is extracted ONCE and every
     dependent field is computed from it, so that class of contradiction
     is unrepresentable.
  2. SILENCE READ AS ABSENCE. A report describes what is notable; it does
     not enumerate every normal tooth. Asked "what is the eruption state
     of tooth 48", a model handed a report that never names 48 answers
     "absent" -- which is a claim the report never made. Stage 1 asks only
     for what the text states, and stage 2 applies the defaults in code.
  3. INVENTED FIELDS. The image-shaped prompts carry visual_evidence and
     the "how the finding is defined" prose, and the extractor echoed the
     latter back as a field: every maxilla fact in A020_gt.json carries a
     "how_the_finding_is_defined" key that exists in no schema. Stage 2
     builds the objects, so only schema fields can appear.

It is also 17x cheaper: 2 calls per report instead of 34. At 34 the job
had to survive 34 consecutive successful calls per case -- one failure
aborted the case -- and the training split had 14 of 933 reports done.

WHY THE OUTPUT SHAPE STILL MATCHES {case_id}_pred.json EXACTLY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Unchanged from before: evaluating against {case_id}_summary.json would
compare against something already lossy and re-classified. Evaluating
against the (normalized) prediction, field by field, matches the
granularity the VLM was actually asked at. Only the way the GT is
PRODUCED changed, not what it is.

NULL MEANS "THE REPORT DID NOT SAY"
────────────────────────────────────
Some fields have no neutral value to default to -- mandible_canal_*.
location is enum lingual|buccal, and a report that never describes the
canal's course supports neither. Those stay null rather than being filled
with a guess, and structured_findings_evaluation.py drops null-GT pairs from
exact-match scoring instead of counting the prediction wrong for
answering something the reference never claimed. Fields that DO have a
neutral value (extent "none", mucosa "normal", every bool, every list)
get it, which is what the report's silence actually means for them.

dentition_type is not a field on either side -- it is DERIVED by
postprocess_pred.build_dentition_type from primary_teeth + eruption, and
postprocess runs on the prediction side too, so the two agree by
construction. Nothing scores the field directly any more.

RE-EXPANDING WITHOUT THE GPU
─────────────────────────────
Stage 2 is pure CPU, so tuning it does not need a vLLM server:

    python code/ground_truth/parse_reports_to_gt.py --from-report-facts \\
        --reports-dir dataset/training/reports \\
        --schema schema/schema.json \\
        --out-dir dataset/training/outputs/ground_truth

re-derives every {case}_gt.json from the report_facts already on disk.
Same relationship scripts/postprocess_now.sh has to the VQA pipeline.

Usage:
    python code/ground_truth/parse_reports_to_gt.py \\
        --reports-dir dataset/training/reports \\
        --schema      schema/schema.json \\
        --out-dir     dataset/training/outputs/ground_truth \\

#
# The same defect the MAXILLA_SCOPES note above describes, fixed a different
# way for the fields that keep a three-way enum. Stage 1 is handed two or
# three values and must pick one even where the report picks none, so it
# reaches for a strong one: across the 1274 training drafts the sinus scope
# came back "fully_included" 53 times while only 11 reports contain any
# full-inclusion wording at all, and it came back null 2410 times.
#
# The rule, per the convention: a scope is partially_included UNLESS the
# report earns something stronger.
#
#   fully_included  the report SAYS so -- "completely/fully/entirely
#                   included", "included in its entirety". Anything weaker,
#                   including a bare "sinuses included in the scan volume",
#                   is not enough: a dental CBCT essentially never closes a
#                   sinus's superior border or contains a whole condyle.
#   not_included    the DRAFT says so, and the field allows it. This one
#                   trusts stage 1 rather than a regex on purpose -- reports
#                   phrase exclusion many ways ("the acquisition volume
#                   ... excludes the condylar processes bilaterally"), and
#                   the draft gets 2414 condyle sides right that a phrase
#                   list would drop to partially_included.

    return f"""You are reading a dental radiology report and recording, as JSON, ONLY what
the report actually says about the {arch.upper()}: FDI {quadrants}.

RULES
1. Record statements, do not make judgements. If the report does not mention
   something, leave the field at its default: [] for every list, "none" for
   alveolar_atrophy and periodontal_extent, null for a nullable enum, false
   for a bool. Silence is NOT a finding -- a report describes what is
   notable and does not list every normal tooth. In particular, a tooth the
   report never names is NOT absent: leave it out of both teeth_present and
   teeth_absent.
2. Copy tooth-number enumerations COMPLETELY. "Teeth 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38,
   42, 43, 44, 45 and 48 are present" is eleven numbers in teeth_present --
   every one of them, none dropped, none invented.
2a. NO TOOTH BELONGS IN BOTH PRESENCE LISTS, and an explicit absence beats
   an inferred presence. A005's report says "Complete mandibular dentition;
   18 and 28 absent in the maxilla" -- a completeness claim about the LOWER
   jaw and an absence about the upper. Read wholesale, it produced a maxilla
   with 11-17 and 21-28 present AND 18, 28 absent: the completeness claim
   applied to the wrong arch, then 18 subtracted from it and 28 forgotten.
   A completeness claim ("complete dentition", "presence of all dental
   elements") counts only for the arch the sentence names, and whatever it
   licenses, every tooth the report calls absent comes out of the presence
   list.
3. Only FDI numbers in {quadrants} belong in this answer -- ignore what the
   report says about the other jaw's TEETH. The non-tooth fields at the end
   are the exception: the sentence they answer often sits under its own
   heading rather than under "{arch}", and it still belongs here.
4. A tooth belongs in as many finding lists as the report supports -- a
   root-canal-treated tooth carrying a crown appears in BOTH "endodontic"
   and "crowns". Do not pick one.
5. Do not copy prose into the JSON: no free-text keys, no extra keys, no
   explanations. Only the field names listed below.
6. AN IMPACTED TOOTH AND THE TOOTH IT PRESSES ON ARE DIFFERENT TEETH.
   "38 mesioverted impacting on the crown of 37, 48 impacting on the distal
   root of 47" reports TWO impacted teeth, 38 and 48. 37 and 47 are what they
   press against and are NOT impacted. After any of
       impacting on / impinging on / pressing against / encroaching on /
       in (close) relationship with / in contact with / in contiguity with
   the tooth named is the one being pressed upon -- unless that tooth carries
   the impaction word itself: "the mandibular canal is in close relationship
   with IMPACTED tooth 48" reports 48 as impacted, because the subject there
   is the canal, not another tooth.
7. A CROWN IS A PROSTHESIS; A RESTORATION ON A CROWN IS A FILLING. The word
   "crown" alone is anatomy -- the top of the tooth.
       crowns:   prosthetic crown, capsule, bridge, prosthetic rehabilitation,
                 cantilever, splinted crowns
       fillings: conservative restoration, restoration involving/on the crown,
                 filling, composite, amalgam, Black class restoration,
                 coronal restoration
   "Conservative restorations are present on the crowns of teeth 23, 24, 25,
   26, 27 and a probable prosthetic crown on tooth 16" is FIVE fillings
   (23-27) and ONE crown (16). Do not give all six teeth to both lists: when
   one sentence names two findings, split the teeth between them by which
   clause each number sits in. Rule 4 still holds for a tooth the report
   really does describe twice ("prosthetic crown on 36, which has undergone
   endodontic therapy" is 36 in BOTH crowns and endodontic).
8. A FINDING ON AN ABSENT TOOTH IS NOT A FINDING ON A TOOTH. If the report
   says the tooth is missing, what stands in its place belongs to the
   prosthesis or the socket, not to the tooth:
       pontic, prosthetic replacement element, cantilevered crown,
       crown on the implant in position X, residual/remnant material,
       post-extraction socket, root remnant
   "22 absent with a prosthetic replacement element" puts 22 in teeth_absent
   and in NO finding list. "Prosthetic crown on endosseous implants in
   positions 46 and 47" is an implant finding, not a crowns finding.
9. A TRAILING CLAUSE BELONGS TO ITS OWN SUBJECT, not to the whole sentence.
   "Multiple edentulism with absence of teeth 45, 46, 47, 48, 35, 36 and 37,
   and presence of a root remnant of 32, previously treated endodontically"
   reports endodontic treatment on 32 ALONE. The seven absent teeth are not
   endodontically treated -- they are not there.
10. An orthodontic SPLINT or RETAINER is an appliance, not a finding. "Lingual
   retainer from 33 to 43" is neither impaction nor a crown; those teeth get
   no finding from that sentence.
11a. A ROOT REMNANT IS A TOOTH THAT IS STILL THERE. A retained root is tooth
   substance at that position, so "15 is a remnant" or "a root remnant of
   tooth 22 can be appreciated" puts that FDI in root_remnants AND in
   teeth_present -- never in teeth_absent. Absence is a separate statement
   the report has to make itself ("absent", "missing", "extracted"); it does
   not follow from the remnant, and inferring it is the commonest way this
   field goes wrong.
11. CARIES AND A FILLING ARE OPPOSITE STATES OF ONE SURFACE. Decay is damage;
   a restoration is what replaced the damage. A tooth the report calls
   carious goes in "caries" and NOT in "fillings", and the reverse. Read the
   clause the number sits in: "Conservative dental treatment is present at
   16-14. Carious process involving 16-14-24" gives fillings [16, 14] and
   caries [16, 14, 24] -- 24 is carious only, because the first sentence
   never names it. "N with restoration of a carious lesion" is the one case
   that reads BOTH ways round: the caries was treated, so it is a filling.
12. A POSITION CAN BE NAMED WITHOUT A NUMBER, AND THE TOOTH TYPE IS PART OF
   IT. "In the canine region of the 4th quadrant" is FDI 43 -- quadrant 4 is
   lower right, and its canine is 43. Resolve these, but resolve them
   exactly:
       central incisor 1  lateral incisor 2  canine 3  first premolar 4
       second premolar 5  first molar 6  second molar 7  third molar 8
   The same digits are what an ORDINAL names, counting from the midline:
   "III quadrant: the fourth tooth shows destructive caries" is the
   quadrant as the first digit and the ordinal as the second, so 34. "IV
   quadrant: the mesial surface of the fifth tooth is in contact with the
   distal surface of the fourth tooth" is 45 and 44.
   so the canine of quadrant 2 is 23, not 24. A GROUP name expands only to
   the teeth that group contains: "the upper canine-incisor group" is
   13-11 and 21-23, and never a molar.

   BUT ONLY A CLAIM ABOUT ALL OF THE GROUP EXPANDS TO ALL OF IT. Compare:
       "THE DISTAL TEETH of the 1st quadrant have been endodontically
        treated"      -> a claim about every one of them: 16, 17, 18.
       "Presence OF ROOT REMNANTS IN the molar region of the 1st quadrant"
                      -> a claim that some exist there. The region is known,
                         the teeth are not, and 16, 17, 18 asserts three
                         remnants where the report may describe one.
   The first names its teeth; the second names a place. Give the second to
   "unlocated" with its quadrant -- rule 14 -- and never to a finding list.

   NEVER OVER-ASSUME. A plural on its own is not a count: "root remnants in
   the molar region" licenses no particular tooth, and answering 16, 17 and
   18 asserts three findings the report never made. Record only what is
   named -- if another sentence says "root remnants of tooth 17", that is
   the one tooth you have. Where the report itself quantifies ("two root
   remnants", "multiple remnants") and still does not say which, keep it in
   "unlocated" and let a reader decide.
   When the phrase does not pin the tooth down at all ("the posterior
   sector", "the edentulous areas"), the same applies.
13. A SIDE-SCOPED FIELD TAKES ONLY TEETH OF ITS OWN SIDE. canal_right and
   sinus_right hold right-side FDIs, canal_left and sinus_left left-side
   ones, and a tooth's own number says which side it is on. A sentence that
   covers both sides at once still assigns each tooth by its number: "The
   mandibular canal has a predominantly lingual course bilaterally, in close
   relationship with the roots of tooth 37 on the left" puts 37 in
   canal_left ALONE -- "bilaterally" describes the course, not the contact,
   and 37 is a left-side tooth either way. Never list one tooth on both
   sides.
14. WHEN THE TOOTH CANNOT BE DETERMINED, GIVE THE QUADRANT.
   An implant or a bridge may be located by region rather than by tooth
   ("two implants in the posterior mandible", "a bridge in the left
   maxillary sector"): give "fdi"/"span_start"/"span_end" as null, put the
   words the report used in "location", and give "quadrant" as 1, 2, 3 or 4
   whenever the region names one -- "the left maxillary sector" is quadrant
   2, "the posterior right mandible" is 4. Leave "quadrant" null only when
   the report does not narrow it that far ("the posterior sectors",
   "bilaterally"). For any OTHER finding whose tooth you cannot pin down,
   add one entry to "unlocated", with its quadrant on the same rule, rather
   than putting a guessed number in a finding list -- a wrong tooth is a
   false statement about a real tooth, while an unlocated finding is merely
   one nobody can score. Neither is invented and neither is dropped.
14a. A RANGE IN A FINDING SENTENCE SWEEPS THE ARCH TOO. It is not only
   presence that is stated this way: "the prosthetic crowns of the maxillary
   teeth from 17 to 26" is thirteen crowned teeth, 17-16-15-14-13-12-11 then
   21-22-23-24-25-26, and "Teeth from 13 to 23 endodontically treated" is
   six. Counting 13, 14, 15 ... 18, 21, 22, 23 instead puts 18 in a run it
   is not in and drops 11 and 12 out of one they are in. The rule is the
   same wherever the range appears: follow the arch, never the numbers.
15. A PERIODONTAL POCKET IS NOT A PERIAPICAL LESION, AND IT IS NOT A CBCT
   FINDING AT ALL. A pocket is a soft-tissue measurement; what a CBCT shows
   is the bone that receded around it, which this schema already records as
   periodontal_extent and periodontal_pattern. "Severe periodontal pocket
   due to horizontal bone resorption involving teeth 28, 27 and 26" is
   resorption, and belongs there and nowhere else -- it is not
   periapical_lesions, which is a radiolucency AT THE APEX of a root, and
   not caries. A080's report says exactly that sentence and its extraction
   answered periapical lesions on nine teeth.
16. A HEDGE ABOUT WHICH FINDING IT IS MEANS NO FINDING. The report is
   allowed to decline, and when it does, record nothing rather than picking
   the likelier half:
       "not well distinguishable between post-and-core or endodontic
        treatment"          -> neither "post_and_core" nor "endodontic"
       "the presence of a post-and-core cannot be excluded"
                            -> not an assertion that one is there
   Put the tooth in "uncertain_teeth" instead, which records the doubt
   without claiming the finding. This is NOT the same as the corpus's
   ordinary register: "probable conservative treatment involving 34",
   "likely rebuilt with a post-and-core" and "apparently adequate" all name
   a finding and estimate its confidence -- record those normally.

    Stage 1 offers two values and describes them as "fully covered by bone vs.
    partly through", so the model has to pick one even where the report picks
    neither -- and it reaches for the first. Two ways that goes wrong, and the
    render contradicts both:

      * OSTEO-mucosal inclusion. The word names bone over part of the crown
        and mucosa over the rest, so part of the crown is already through the
        bone and is drawn standing clear of it.
      * a bare "impacted", with no depth word at all -- "the right mandibular
        canal is in close relationship with impacted tooth 48". That states
        the tooth cannot erupt normally, which is what `impacted` records; it
        does not state that the tooth is entirely enclosed in bone.

    So complete_bony_inclusion survives only where a sentence naming this tooth
    AND making an eruption claim also says the tooth is in bone. Anything else
    that sentence can support falls to partially_erupted -- which is already
    this field's default for an unreadable value, so an explicit-but-unearned
    answer now behaves like a missing one.

    Per tooth, because one report routinely describes several third molars in
    different states, and only over sentences that make an eruption claim,
    because "impacted in bone" three sentences away is about another tooth.
    When no such sentence names this FDI the state is LEFT ALONE: reports write
    ranges ("teeth 48-37") and periphrases ("the tooth germ"), so a failure to
    match text is not evidence about depth. Like the other stage-2 source
    guards it is skipped when the report text is not to hand, and it can only

    A position the report never mentions is resolved by `presence_enumerated`
    -- which list the report itself ENUMERATED. An enumeration is exhaustive
    by construction, so "Absence of teeth 36, 37, 45, 46 and 48" makes every
    unnamed position present, and "teeth 32, 33 ... are present" makes every
    unnamed position absent. Enumerating both, or neither, leaves the
    remainder unstated: guessing all sixteen from silence is exactly the
    failure this rewrite removes.

    It has to be asked rather than inferred from which list came back
    non-empty. A013's report enumerates only absences; its teeth_present
    holds 41, 42, 43, 44, 31 and 33 because those are the teeth a sentence
    about calculus deposits happens to name. Reading that as an exhaustive
    presence list makes tooth 32 -- which the report never mentions and its
    absence list never claims -- absent.

    teeth 16, 17, 18, 21, ..." beats the presence list, because A013's 21
    reached teeth_present only via the bridge that spans the gap it leaves,
