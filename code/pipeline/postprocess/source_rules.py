code/pipeline/postprocess/source_rules.py

The ten source rules of docs/postprocess_pipeline.md, applied to a finished summary.

WHY A POST-PASS AND NOT SURGERY IN postprocess_pred.py
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Each rule says "this field should come from a different source". Implementing
that inside the nine builders that currently produce those fields would touch
`collect_arch_absent`, `build_impacted_teeth`, `build_implants`,
`build_single_canal`, `build_alveolar_bone_atrophy` and the restoration and
endodontic summaries -- six hundred lines of interlocking logic, in a file with
no test suite, where the only verification available is a survey diff.

So the rules run afterwards, over the finished dict, exactly as
`validate_summary_with_facts.py` already does. Three consequences, all of them
wanted:

  * With no facts file the module is a no-op and postprocess behaves as before.
  * Every rule is one function, named for its section in the document, and can
    be turned off on its own.
  * What each rule changed is recorded in `source_rules` inside the summary,
    so a rewrite is never silent -- the same contract audit_facts.py keeps.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
─────────────────────────────
`fixed bridges` does not DERIVE anything: the mask's per-arch bridge finding is
written into the facts file by `audit_facts.py --derive-bridge-arches`, and this
module only USES it. It uses it as a SOURCE, not a gate -- an arch the mask
marks gets a bridge whether the model found one or not, because gating alone
left 4 of the 6 mask-confirmed cases reporting no bridge at all. See
apply_bridges. And `crown` is applied because the summary JSON is an instrument
worth keeping accurate, even though the crown renderer is silenced and no crown
reaches the report either way.

THE MEASUREMENTS ARE IN THE DOCUMENT, NOT HERE
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Every rule below is one paragraph in docs/postprocess_pipeline.md with the table
that chose it. This module states what it does and points there; it does not
restate the evidence, which would then have two homes and drift.

ALL OF IT IS VALIDATE-40 EVIDENCE. See the TODO in that document: nine of the
ten rules are unconfirmed on the training split, and two of them (crown,
impaction C-vs-E) rest on margins inside the noise of 40 cases.

def absent_list(facts: Dict) -> Set[int]:
    """
    facts.structured.teeth_absent, minus the maxillary positions when the mask
    says the maxilla was not in the volume.

    What the gate filters is UNASSESSABLE positions rather than wrong ones:
    `teeth_absent` is the complement of `teeth_present`, so a mask silence at a
    position means either "no tooth" or "no image", and `fov.maxilla` is the
    field that says which.

    THE EVIDENCE IS THE REPORTS, NOT THE GENERATED GT (survey_upper_mentions.py
    over all 1000 reference reports). Where fov.maxilla == "excluded", 77% of
    reports make only an arch statement -- "the maxilla is partially included
    in the acquisition" and nothing further -- and 13% never refer to the upper
    arch at all; 15% of those cases name an upper tooth anywhere and only 5%
    call one absent, against 26% where the maxilla is imaged. Sixteen upper
    absences there answer a question the radiologist declined to answer.

    AT FACT LEVEL THE GATE IS A WASH, and the docstring should not claim
    otherwise: scored on positions a report actually settles, F1 0.858 with the
    gate against 0.860 without, trading 56 true positives for 66 false ones.
    (The much larger margin the {case}_gt.json answered set reports -- 0.824 vs
    0.728 -- is presence_enumerated fill-in: 2072 of its 2491 answered upper
    positions in excluded cases were never stated by a report.) The gate stays
    because 1904 of the mask's 2026 upper absence claims in those cases land on
    positions no report settles at all: fact-level scoring drops them, RadFact
    charges every sentence built from them.

    Gate on "excluded" only, and gate the whole upper arch:

      - "partial" is a maxilla that WAS imaged -- gating it collapses recall
        from 0.860 to 0.655.
      - firing only where the mask carries no upper tooth is not supportable:
        those 7 cases settle ONE upper position between them, and 101 of the
        354 excluded cases carry the whole upper arch in the mask anyway.
      - an empty upper arch with the maxilla IMAGED is edentulism, not an FOV
        artefact: gating that too costs F1 0.858 -> 0.850 (0.870 -> 0.828 on
        validate) and would delete A018's "Completely edentulous maxilla".

# ── THE RULE — alveolar bone atrophy ────────────────────────────────────────

def apply_atrophy(summary: Dict, facts: Dict, notes: List[str]) -> None:
    """
    State atrophy when the arch carries an EDENTULOUS REGION at all -- either
    because the prediction says so (`present`, which is what puts the block in
    the summary in the first place) or because the mask says the arch has no
    teeth left.

    THE GATE MOVED, 2026-08-17, from full edentulism to `present`. Full
    edentulism is the safe end of the same prior and it scored like one: 4 TP,
    0 FP, 18 FN over the 80 validate arches -- precision 1.00 at recall 0.18,
    every error a miss. Atrophy is not confined to jaws that lost every tooth,
    and the mask gate could not say so. Gating on `present` instead reads
    12 TP / 9 FP / 10 FN, recall 0.18 -> 0.55 for precision 1.00 -> 0.57.

    The mask term is KEPT as a second trigger rather than replaced, because it
    fires where `present` cannot: one of the 5 fully-edentulous arches has no
    summary block at all (the model answered present=false on a jaw with no
    teeth in it). Or-ing the two is a strict gain on this run -- +1 TP, no new
    FP -- and it keeps the anatomy prior for exactly the arches the model
    declines to see.

    `present` alone is close to trusting the model outright: on all 21 arches
    where the block exists, its own `atrophy` was already true, so this rule
    now filters almost nothing and earns its keep through the mask term and
    through fully_edentulous. Dropping the `or edentulous` below is the pure
    present-gate; dropping the whole rule is the raw prediction (13/10/9).

    WHY ONLY WHEN IT SPEAKS. `fov.condyles` is written by extract_facts.py when
    the mandible mask touches the volume's superior boundary; when the condition
    does not fire the key is simply absent (33 vs 7 of the 40 validate cases,
    519 vs 63 of 582 training). Treating that silence as `included` -- i.e.
    letting the mask answer the whole axis -- is the WORST variant measured:
    0.525 validate / 0.545 heldout / 0.699 training, below both the reads and a
    constant. Used only where it actually claims something, it is the best:

        pre-rule, per side, no merge          0.575 / 0.568 / 0.716
        merged reads alone                    0.600 / 0.591 / 0.716
        facts alone, silence = included       0.525 / 0.545 / 0.699
        THIS RULE (facts win, else merged)    0.600 / 0.636 / 0.720

    THE MAXILLA CLAUSE ADDS NOTHING TODAY and is kept as a guard: `fov.maxilla
    == excluded` implies `fov.condyles == excluded` in 14/14 validate cases,
    4/4 heldout and 331 of 340 training. It earns 0 sides on every split. In the
    9 training cases where the two disagree it overrides the more direct
    measurement, which is the cost of keeping it -- accepted because a volume
    that stops below the maxilla cannot hold a condyle, and because a facts file
    without `fov.condyles` would otherwise leave the axis to the reads alone.

    WHAT NONE OF THIS BUYS. Every winning variant lands on `not_included` for
    all 40 validate cases: 0.600 is exactly the majority-class score, and on
    training the constant (0.722) still edges this rule (0.720). It buys a
    coherent source hierarchy and a bilaterally consistent statement, not signal.
