code/pipeline/postprocess/postprocess_pred.py

Converts a raw {case_id}_pred.json (from run_vqa_inference.py) into a
compact, pre-classified {case_id}_summary.json meant to be handed to a
report-writing LLM or template renderer, per schema/schema.json (v6.1).

WHAT SCHEMA V6.1 CHANGED HERE, AND WHY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
v6.1 deleted eight facts outright and reshaped most of the rest. The facts
that went away were not simply renamed -- each one's content now has to be
DERIVED from what is left:

  - absent_teeth_{arch} is gone. Absence is derived (collect_arch_absent)
    from the per-tooth composite reads plus dental_arch_findings_{arch},
    whose "findings" map is keyed by the PRESENT teeth.
  - impacted_teeth_{arch} is gone, and as of v6.3 so is
    tooth_{fdi}_impaction. Impaction is unioned across the four dedicated
    wisdom-tooth 3D facts and the "impacted" value in
    dental_arch_findings_{arch}; see build_impacted_teeth for what the
    composite read's removal costs (non-wisdom impaction) and buys.
  - root_remnant_{arch} is gone -- tooth_{fdi}_morphology.is_remnant is
    the single remaining source, so root remnants no longer have two
    sources to reconcile.
  - mandible_scope is gone. The mandible's inclusion level is derived from
    the two condyle scopes (build_mandible_scope); the condyle facts
    themselves are inclusion-only now, with no morphology field.
  - nasal_cavity is gone, and as of v6.4 so is its image, so the maxilla
    section has no turbinate block.
  - alveolar_bone_atrophy_{arch} is one presence + one yes/no per arch (v6.4
    replaced the graded extent with the `atrophy` bool), not a per-region
    list; bone_quality_{arch} is one most-notable finding with a type and an
    FDI-anchored location, not two free-text prose fields, and it is now
    gated on the per-tooth tooth_{fdi}_bone_quality read.
  - tooth_{fdi}_restoration is gone as of v6.4. Its restoration_type enum
    became three bools on tooth_{fdi}_morphology (with_fillings /
    with_full_crown / with_post_and_core), and the endodontic fact's
    root_canal_treatment bool became that same block's with_endo. Both are
    read back through composite_restoration_type / composite_morphology, so
    the gates below still vote on one value per tooth.
  - implants_{arch}, fixed_bridges_{arch} and primary_teeth_{arch} all became
    OBJECT facts wrapping the value that used to be the fact itself
    (implants[], bridges[], primary_teeth[]) -- read as before, they silently
    yielded nothing.
  - Every object fact now leads with a free-text "visual_evidence" field.
    It is carried in the prediction for auditing and never rendered.

  - AN EXCLUDED MAXILLA IS EMPTY (2026-08-10). The maxilla's inclusion gates
    the whole arch: not_included nulls every other maxilla fact and drops
    every tooth_11..28 read before any builder runs, while
    partially_included and fully_included keep everything. This supersedes
    the per-tissue split described under build_maxilla_section, where a
    not_included arch still reported its teeth. See drop_excluded_maxilla;
    --keep-excluded-maxilla restores the old behaviour.
    WHERE THAT ANSWER COMES FROM (2026-08-17): the FACTS, not the model --
    facts.structured.fov.maxilla, measured off the mask, overwrites
    maxilla_scope.maxilla_included in both directions before the gate reads
    it. The model's own answer decides only when no facts file was given.
    See facts_maxilla_included.
  - dentition_type is NOT an asked VQA fact. It's derived here from
    primary_teeth_mandible/_maxilla + tooth_{fdi}_eruption, per the
    threshold rule agreed this session (see build_dentition_type).
  - Per EXPLICIT instruction: NO merging across arches (mandible and
    maxilla are reported fully independently, each with its own
    bone_quality closing statement) and NO merging mandible canal
    right/left into one "both normal" sentence -- unlike maxilla sinuses,
    which DO have a real "both normal" merged sentence and keep that
    Type B group logic.

THE GATES ARE OFF -- THIS IS A BRIDGE, NOT A FILTER (2026-08-07)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This module used to adjudicate the model's claims: findings asked TWICE --
once of the whole-arch panoramic (dental_arch_findings_{arch}) and once of the
tooth's own composite crop (tooth_{fdi}_morphology's with_* bools) -- were
dropped when the two sources disagreed, and teeth the model called uncertain
were forced back to "normal".

Every one of those gates that was ever surveyed cost recall and left precision
flat (endodontic 0.16 -> 0.17, fillings 0.17 -> 0.17, impaction 0.21 -> 0.19),
so they are ALL OFF now. REQUIRE_CROSS_SOURCE_AGREEMENT is the master switch
and it is False; DEMOTE_UNCERTAIN_TO_NORMAL is False beside it. What reaches
the summary is the UNION of what the sources claimed.

The gates are kept, not deleted, and every vote still RUNS -- the losers are
recorded under arch_findings.cross_source_dropped / .uncertain_demoted but no
longer removed, so the old arm is one flag away (--cross-validate,
--demote-uncertain) and both arms are readable from a single run.

WHAT THIS MODULE STILL DOES, and why it is not a pass-through:
  - DERIVES the facts schema v6.1--v6.4 deleted (absence, impaction, dentition
    type, mandible scope -- see the section above);
  - GROUPS teeth that share a finding, so the renderer emits one sentence for
    a group rather than one per tooth;
  - CLASSIFIES into the Type A / B / C rules below, which decide what is
    stated when normal and what is silent;
  - REPAIRS impossible output -- per-tooth findings on teeth reported absent
    (toothless_fdis), canal adjacency on anterior or opposite-side teeth
    (CANAL_ADJACENT_FDIS), implants at the other arch's FDIs, bridges with no
    parseable span, enforce_scope_consistency. These are NOT precision gates:
    they remove what cannot exist, not what might be wrong, and they stay on.

ABSTAIN remains a distinct verdict from DENY throughout, because the arch read
carries one finding per tooth by priority and has no value at all for crowns,
so its silence is usually structural rather than a denial. That distinction
now only shapes the audit record, not what is reported.

THE CLASSIFICATION THIS SCRIPT STILL IMPLEMENTS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Type A -- silent when normal, no substitute sentence. Most per-tooth
            facts and most single whole-arch facts. Omitted entirely
            when normal/empty.

  Type B -- GROUPED features, now ONLY maxilla sinuses right/left (the
            one pair that still has a real "both normal" merged sentence
            in the decision tree):
              - if BOTH sides normal -> merge into ONE summary flag
              - if EITHER side abnormal -> BOTH sides included in the
                summary, including the normal one (no silent dropping)
            Mandible canals are explicitly NOT Type B anymore -- always
            two independent entries, right and left, no merge.

  Type C -- ALWAYS stated regardless of normal/abnormal. Both arch scope
            statements (the mandible's derived from its condyles, the
            maxilla's from maxilla_scope) and BOTH condyles, in every case,
            never dropped for being normal or for missing a VQA answer.
            Condyles carry INCLUSION ONLY as of v6.1 -- morphology
            classification is out of the schema's scope.

# are folded onto the internal tokens by ARCH_VALUE_ALIASES, so post_and_core
# on "filling"/"caries" below is untouched.
#
# "post_and_core" stays in this tuple even though no v7.1 answer can contain
# it: stored v6.x predictions do, and an out-of-enum value is read as
# "unreadable", which would silently turn every posted tooth in those files

#
# Why a deterministic gate rather than trusting the prompt's base-rate
# instruction alone: measured on the first 5 v6.1 predictions, the arch read
# called 43.4% of teeth abnormal, and the per-tooth composite read called 44%
# of teeth crowned and 44% root-filled -- against reference reports where
# post_and_core appears in 6% of REPORTS at all. The v4 evaluation shows the
# same asymmetry from the other side: logical_precision 0.187 against
# logical_recall 0.354, i.e. the reports over-claim. Every demoted tooth
# removes a sentence from the report, so this trades recall for precision on
# purpose, against the weaker of the two numbers.
#
# TURNED OFF (2026-08-07). The measured trade never materialised: across the
# v5/v6 validate runs the gates in this file cost recall without moving
# precision (see REQUIRE_CROSS_SOURCE_AGREEMENT below for the per-finding
# numbers), and this one is the same shape -- "the model said it was unsure"
# is an argument for weighting the claim, not for overwriting it with a
# confident "normal". Postprocess is a BRIDGE from prediction to report now:
# it derives, groups and reconciles shapes, and does not delete findings.

# The gate itself is kept and still RUNS: the summary records what it would
# have demoted under arch_findings.uncertain_demoted either way, so the arm is
# one flag (or --demote-uncertain) away and remains measurable.

# ── The cross-source agreement gate ───────────────────────────────────────
#
# Several findings are asked TWICE, of two different images: once of the
# whole-arch panoramic (dental_arch_findings_{arch}) and once of that tooth's
# own composite crop (tooth_{fdi}_restoration / _endodontic_treatment /
# _endodontic_treatment). The schema says so itself -- "Cross-checked in
# postprocessing against tooth_{fdi}_morphology and
# tooth_{fdi}_endodontic_treatment for the same tooth".
#
# Until now that cross-check only ANNOTATED: the builders reported the UNION
# of the two reads and listed the disagreements under "conflicting_sources",
# so a finding exactly one source claimed -- and the other explicitly
# denied -- still reached the report. THE GATE BELOW DROPS IT INSTEAD.
#
# Measured on outputs/aksssr_v5_validate/predictions (40 cases), counting only
# teeth where BOTH reads actually answered:
#
#     root_canal_treatment    3 agree   79 contradict
#     fillings                2 agree   52 contradict
#     post_and_core           1 agree   17 contradict
#
# The two reads are very nearly uncorrelated, so this is a much heavier gate
# than DEMOTE_UNCERTAIN_TO_NORMAL: it removes ~96% of the restorative and
# endodontic findings these sections used to carry. That is a deliberate
# precision-for-recall trade, in the same direction as the uncertainty gate
# and for the same reason (v4 scored logical_precision 0.187 against
# logical_recall 0.354 -- the reports over-claim), but it is large enough that
# it must be measurable both ways. Hence the flag: set it False (or pass
# --no-cross-validate) to restore the union behaviour. The dropped teeth are
# recorded under arch_findings.cross_source_dropped either way, so one run
# shows exactly what the gate took out.
#
# TURNED OFF (2026-08-07) -- THIS IS NOW THE MASTER SWITCH, AND IT IS OFF.
# The per-finding exemptions below were added one at a time, and each one came
# back with the same measurement: the gate halved or quartered recall and left
# precision flat (0.16 -> 0.17 endodontic, 0.17 -> 0.17 fillings, 0.21 -> 0.19
# impaction). Every finding that was ever surveyed answered the same way, so
# the exemption list had become the rule and the gate the exception.
# Postprocess is a BRIDGE between the predictions and the report: it derives
# the values the schema no longer asks for, groups teeth that share a finding,
# and shapes the summary the renderer consumes -- it does not adjudicate the
# model's claims.
#
# WHAT THIS ONE FLAG NOW TURNS OFF, because each is subordinate to it:
#   - the per-finding cross-source votes (CROSS_VALIDATE_IMPACTION,
#     CROSS_VALIDATE_ENDODONTIC, CROSS_VALIDATE_RESTORATIONS);
#   - the caries agreement gate (REQUIRE_CARIES_ARCH_AGREEMENT);
#   - the implant-on-present-tooth gate (DROP_IMPLANTS_ON_PRESENT_TEETH);
#   - the bone-quality per-tooth confirmation
#     (REQUIRE_BONE_QUALITY_TOOTH_CONFIRMATION).
# The subordinate flags KEEP their measured values, so the record of which
# finding each measurement was taken on survives; with the master off they are
# all inert, and --cross-validate restores the whole previous arm exactly.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT TURNED OFF, because it is a consistency repair
# rather than a precision gate -- it removes output that CANNOT exist, not
# output that MIGHT be wrong: per-tooth findings on absent teeth
# (toothless_fdis), canal adjacency claimed for anterior or opposite-side teeth
# (CANAL_ADJACENT_FDIS), implants placed at the other arch's FDIs, bridges with
# no parseable span, and enforce_scope_consistency.
#
# Every vote still RUNS with the gate off and every loser is still recorded
# under arch_findings.cross_source_dropped, so this arm stays fully auditable
# and one flag away from the old behaviour.
REQUIRE_CROSS_SOURCE_AGREEMENT = False

# ── ...except for impaction, which is exempt ──────────────────────────────
#
# The gate above assumes the sources are interchangeable, so that a
# disagreement is evidence against the finding. For impaction they are not,
# and the gate inverts quality instead of filtering it. Measured on
# outputs/aksssr_v5_validate against the 32 impacted teeth the reference
# reports state (survey_findings.py --category impaction):
#
#     source      claims   correct   precision
#     3d_render       74        21        0.28
#     panoramic       36         9        0.25
#     composite       18         0        0.00
#
# The composite read never once identifies an impacted tooth correctly, and
# on a wisdom tooth it is the source that DENIES: its "none" outvotes the
# 3d_render read that is right nearly a third of the time. Meanwhile a lone
# composite claim on a NON-wisdom tooth passes unchallenged, because the
# other two sources are wisdom-only and abstain there. So the gate removes
# the good source's true positives and keeps the bad source's false ones:
#
#     stage             claims   correct   precision   recall
#     union (no gate)      112        24        0.21     0.75
#     majority vote         26         5        0.19     0.16
#
# It discarded 19 of the 24 true impactions the pipeline had actually found,
# for no precision gain at all (0.19 vs 0.21). Recall drops 4.7x to buy
# nothing, so impaction does not pass through the gate.
#
# This is a per-finding exemption, NOT a change to the gate: the restorative
# and endodontic findings still cross-validate, where the same survey shows
# the two reads really are of comparable quality (endodontic: composite 0.18
# vs panoramic 0.24) and a disagreement is genuinely uninformative.
# Set this True to restore the majority vote; --no-cross-validate still turns
# everything off at once. Either way, the teeth the vote WOULD have removed
# are still recorded under arch_findings.cross_source_dropped.impacted, so a
# single run shows exactly what the exemption let through.
CROSS_VALIDATE_IMPACTION = False

# ── ...and the same exemption, on the same evidence, for endodontic

# Whether a composite "carious" needs the panoramic not to contradict it.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. Caries used to be ungated while everything beside it was, and
# the asymmetry showed: on A008 tooth 31 the composite claimed BOTH
# post_and_core and "carious" against a panoramic reading of "normal". The
# post was gated away; the caries -- same composite's word, same panoramic
# contradiction, same tooth -- went through to the report untouched. It
# survived because "caries" was not in ARCH_FINDING_PRIORITY, so arch_verdict
# abstained on it by construction.
#
# WHY IT IS NOW HONEST. Schema v6.2 adds "caries" to the arch enum and to the
# priority order, and tells the arch reader to note caries alongside
# restorations. So a "normal" from a v6.2 arch read is a real denial: the
# reader was asked about decay and recorded none. arch_verdict handles the
# target directly and no caries-specific verdict function is needed --
# "filling"/"post_and_core"/etc. outrank caries and therefore ABSTAIN (a
# restored tooth is frequently restored because of decay, and the enum holds
# one value per tooth), while "normal" falls through to DENY.
#
# THE ONE CAVEAT, and the reason this stays a separate flag. Predictions
# generated BEFORE v6.2 -- everything in outputs/aksssr_v5_* -- come from an
# arch reader that was never asked about caries, so their "normal" denies
# restorations only. Gating those is a precision play, not a deduction, and it
# will drop true caries on teeth the panoramic simply was not looking for
# decay on. Set this False (or pass --no-cross-validate) to measure a run
# without it. Once inference is re-run under v6.2 the caveat lapses.

                   sources, where a 2-vs-1 split really is corroboration
                   against a single dissent rather than a coin flip. A tie
                   does not survive -- a majority has to be a majority.

    (On a two-source finding the two rules coincide, since 1-vs-1 is a tie
    either way. The distinction is kept explicit rather than implicit so that
    adding a third source to a finding is a deliberate decision about which
    rule it should then follow.)

      kept    -- the teeth to report;
      dropped -- the teeth where the vote went against the finding. Always
                 reported, whether or not the gate is on, so a run with the
                 flag off still records exactly what the gate would have taken.

    A finding only ONE source can speak to (every other source ABSTAINing) is
    NOT dropped under either rule: there is no second opinion to disagree with
    it, and requiring corroboration is a stricter rule than requiring
    agreement. The single remaining source is the schema's designated one in
    every such case (crown is composite-only, non-wisdom impaction is

# Does the composite's per-tooth adjacency read get to VETO the 3D read's?
#
# Unmeasured: this source is new, so there is no survey to point at the way
# there is for impaction and the restorations, and an unmeasured gate keeps
# the project default (True) rather than being switched off on a hunch --
# exactly the position REQUIRE_CARIES_ARCH_AGREEMENT is in.
#
# Subordinate to REQUIRE_CROSS_SOURCE_AGREEMENT, like every other per-finding
# gate, so on this arm (master off) the two sources UNION and every tooth the
# vote would have removed is still recorded in the run notes. Once

# Does the composite's location read outrank the 3D read's?

# semi-transparent bone surface, seen from the side. synthesize_report's
# DEFAULT_CANAL_LOCATION note measures what that costs -- of the 5 buccal
# sides in the validate references the 3D read got 0 right, having already
# answered "lingual" on four of them. A coronal cut is the only view that puts
# the canal and BOTH cortical plates in one picture, which is precisely why
# the per-tooth fact was written to be answered from that row alone.
#
# So the molar reads decide the side's location when they answer, the 3D read
# fills in when they do not, and synthesize_report's measured prior still

    enum (regular|lingual|buccal). It is a POSITION axis, not an anomaly
    axis: every canal runs to one side or the other, so there is no "normal"
    value to branch a report sentence on any more, and no `normal` key is

    a legacy "regular" from a prediction generated under the old schema --
    is dropped to None, which reads as "position not stated".

    `absent` (see toothless_fdis) removes teeth that are not in the mouth: a
    canal cannot be in close relationship with the roots of a tooth that
    isn't there. In a fully edentulous mandible this empties the clause

    Impaction, reconciled across the two places the schema still records it --
    there is no impacted_teeth_{arch} fact any more, and as of the v6.3 schema
    no tooth_{fdi}_impaction either:

      1. the four wisdom-tooth 3D-render facts (lower_left_wisdom_tooth etc.),
         an independent read of those four teeth and the only one carrying a
         direction.
      2. dental_arch_findings_{arch}, whose per-tooth enum includes
         "impacted" (wisdom teeth only, by that fact's own definition).

    THE COMPOSITE READ (tooth_{fdi}_impaction) IS GONE and is deliberately not
    consulted even when an older prediction file still carries it. It was
    dropped from the schema as unreliable, which the survey bears out: on
    outputs/aksssr_v5_validate it made 18 impaction claims and got 0 of them
    right (survey_findings.py --category impaction). Reading it from
    legacy predictions would put those 18 known-false claims straight into the
    report, since impaction no longer passes through the agreement gate.

    THE COST is non-wisdom impaction, which now has no dedicated source at
    all: 1 and 2 are both wisdom-only, so an impacted canine or premolar is
    caught only if the panoramic arch read volunteers "impacted" outside the
    third molars. That is a real gap, and a small one -- of the 32 impacted
    teeth in the validate reports exactly one is not a third molar (F006's
    tooth 13), against the 18 false non-wisdom claims the composite read was
    contributing.

    UNIONED, not gated (CROSS_VALIDATE_IMPACTION is off -- see that flag for
    the measurement that settled it). The majority vote below still runs and
    still returns its losers as `dropped`, so arch_findings.cross_source_dropped
    records exactly what a gated run would have removed, but they are reported
    rather than deleted. MAJORITY is now the same rule as UNANIMOUS here, since
    two sources cannot split 2-vs-1; it is left in place as the rule that would
    apply if a third source were ever restored.

    A tooth only one source can speak to is kept, which after the composite
    read's removal is the ordinary case rather than the exception: ABSTAIN
    stays distinct from DENY, so a wisdom tooth is judged by up to two
    opinions and any other tooth by the panoramic read alone.

    `direction` keeps the first non-"none" tipping value seen, in source
    order; the arch read has no direction field, so it can only ever
    contribute "unspecified".

    `absent` (see toothless_fdis) USED TO BE dropped last, after the vote, on
    the rule that a tooth which is not in the mouth cannot be impacted. That
    suppression is now OFF (DROP_IMPACTION_ON_ABSENT_TEETH) -- see that flag
    for the survey that reversed it, and for what the report gives up. The
    absent teeth are still identified and still recorded in `dropped`, so the
    audit trail is unchanged; they are simply no longer removed from `kept`.

    Implants and fixed bridges are deliberately NOT filtered this way (they
    are built elsewhere and never consult `absent`): an implant or a pontic at
    an absent tooth's position is the normal case, not a contradiction --
    those findings describe the SITE, not the tooth.

        old whole-mouth root_canal_treatment list, which no longer exists);
      - each tooth's own tooth_{fdi}_morphology.with_endo, read from that
        tooth's composite crop.

    with_endo is where the composite's root-filling claim lives as of v6.4.
    tooth_{fdi}_endodontic_treatment lost its root_canal_treatment bool and now
    only CHARACTERIZES a filling whose existence with_endo already established
    -- the schema says so in that fact's own question text ("Only answer this
    fact when tooth_{fdi}_morphology.with_endo == true ... presence of root
    canal treatment is established by that gate, not re-asked here"). So the
    vote is cast from the gate flag, and filling_quality/periapical_lesion are
    still read from the endodontic fact below.

    A tooth is reported when at least one source claims the root filling and
    -- with REQUIRE_CROSS_SOURCE_AGREEMENT on -- the other does not deny it.
    A tooth both reads answered and disagreed about is DROPPED, not reported
    with a conflict annotation as it was before the gate; see the gate's own
    comment for the measured effect and the reasoning.

    The arch read being single-finding-per-tooth is handled by arch_verdict,
    not counted as a disagreement: a root-filled tooth that also carries a
    post is filed under post_and_core on the panoramic, which ABSTAINs here
    rather than denying the root filling. Before the gate this showed up as a
    spurious entry in "conflicting_sources".

    `absent` (see toothless_fdis) is dropped from BOTH sources before voting
    -- a tooth that is not in the mouth has no canal to fill, so a claim from
    either call is noise, not a finding to reconcile.

    filling_quality follows the tooth it describes: a root filling the gate
    removed takes its quality grading with it. periapical_lesion does NOT --
    it has only the one source, is a lesion rather than a treatment, and does
    not depend on the root filling being real.

# ── "not_included" means the whole arch, teeth and all ────────────────────
#
# THE RULE (2026-08-10, revised 2026-08-17): the maxilla's inclusion is the
# gate, and with a facts file it is read from the ACQUISITION -- facts
# .structured.fov.maxilla, which extract_facts.py measures off the mask and
# extract_facts.py corrects. Only when there is no facts file does the model's
# own maxilla_scope.maxilla_included decide. Either way the three states are:
#
#     fully_included / partially_included -> KEEP EVERYTHING, unchanged. A
#         partial maxilla is still an imaged maxilla; the report describes
#         what was caught, exactly as the reference reports do ("As far as
#         can be assessed, ...").
#     not_included                        -> DELETE THE ARCH. Every other
#         maxilla fact := None and every tooth_11..28 entry dropped from
#         `teeth`, so nothing maxillary survives to be rendered.
#     unanswered / anything else          -> KEEP. Deleting an arch on the
#         strength of a fact the model never answered would be a guess, and
#         it is the destructive direction of the two.
#
# This SUPERSEDES the earlier per-tissue split (an arch could be
# not_included while its teeth were still reported -- see build_maxilla_
# section). A volume that does not contain the maxilla does not contain the
# maxillary teeth either: they sit in it. Reporting "Maxilla is not included
# in the scan volume." and then listing upper teeth is self-contradictory in
# a way a reader notices immediately, and it is the shape the model actually
# produces -- it is handed the same full-mouth panoramic for both arch
# prompts and answers the maxilla ones whether or not the arch is there.
#
# WHY THE FACTS AND NOT THE MODEL (2026-08-17). "Is the maxilla in this
# volume" is a property of the acquisition, and the mask answers it exactly:
# extract_facts.py already measures `mask == MAXILLA` against the volume's
# superior edge, and extract_facts.py already rewrites fov.maxilla to "excluded"
# below MIN_ARCH_BONE_MM3. The model is answering the same question off one 3D
# render and gets it wrong in the destructive direction -- on validate-40 the
# two disagree four times, and the one disagreement the old gate ACTED on was
# A018: fov "partial", maxillary bone in the mask, a four-sentence maxilla
# paragraph in its reference report ("Completely edentulous maxilla. Severe
# atrophy ... maxillary sinuses ... no osteolytic lesions"), and the arch was
# emptied to a single false sentence because one render looked bare. The three
# disagreements in the other direction (model "included", fov "excluded") were
# already caught by the coverage sidecar, which is the same measurement under
# another name; routing them through the facts only renames the scope_source.
#
# SURVEYED against the consensus ground truth (docs/postprocess.md, THE
# RULE -- maxilla FOV scope): the gate goes 0.850 -> 0.875 on validate-40 and
# does so on ALL THREE model arms, each moving one case and a DIFFERENT case
# per arm (A018 arm 6, S0037 arm 5, S0017 AWQ base) -- every arm invents one
# not_included on a maxilla the mask can see. On the training split the same
# comparison is a tie (0.789 both ways, 24 cases moved, 12-12), against
# in-sample predictions.
#
# WHY NOT THE SUB-DATASET PREFIX, the blunter version of the same idea. The
# datasets do differ in FOV -- from the NIfTI headers of all 622 cases, mean Z
# extent is A 88 mm, F 81 mm, P 50.7 +/- 0.4, S 52.4 +/- 4.0, so P and S are
# ~5 cm single-arch slabs -- but 27% of S reports and 9.5% of P reports DO
# describe upper teeth ("coronal restorations on teeth 26, 14 and 15"), and
# S's modal scope word in the references is "partially included" (31/52), not
# "not included" (19/52). FORCE_MAXILLA_EXCLUDED_PREFIXES below restores the
# blunt version for the arm that wants to measure it; it is empty by default.
#
# NO FACTS FILE, NO CHANGE. facts_maxilla_included returns None then and the
# model's answer is the gate again, exactly as before -- which is also what
# keeps `postprocess_now.sh NO_SOURCE_RULES=1`-style runs comparable.

    a shallow copy of `pred` with new `global`/`teeth` dicts (the caller's
    prediction object is left alone) plus human-readable notes, empty when
    there was nothing to drop.

    maxilla_scope itself is the one maxilla fact KEPT: it carries the only
    true thing left to say about the arch, and build_maxilla_scope reads
    `maxilla_included` off it to set the section's scope level -- nulling it
    would leave level "unknown" -> "Maxilla is partially included in the scan
    volume.", the opposite of what the case just claimed. `forced` rewrites it
    instead of trusting it, for the prefix override, and stamps a scope_source
    so the summary can tell the two apart.

    WHAT SURVIVES, AND WHY (revised 2026-08-10). Every BONE fact goes: they
    are already gated on `bone_imaged` in build_maxilla_section, and nulling
    them here makes the summary say so explicitly. The ARCH-LEVEL TOOTH facts
    stay -- dental_arch_findings_maxilla and the prosthetics that ride with
    it -- because they are read off the PANORAMIC, which still shows the upper
    crowns of a volume that stopped below the maxillary bone. 11.7% of the
    reference reports for exactly those cases describe one ("as far as can be
    visualized, prosthetic crowns are present on teeth 14, 13, 12..."), and
    dropping the fact made that unreachable.

    The per-tooth COMPOSITE reads (tooth_11..28) do NOT survive, for the
    opposite reason: a composite is built around a tooth's own extent and its
    three root panels are empty when the crop has no root in it. Those images
    are no longer generated at all (create_tooth_detail.py), so for a current
    prediction there is nothing here to drop; the drop remains for replaying
    older prediction files that still carry them.

    Net effect: a not_included maxilla reports its teeth and nothing about its
    bone -- the split is by TISSUE, which is where this started before the
    2026-08-10 delete-everything pass. dentition_type still sees
    primary_teeth_maxilla, which is correct: it is a tooth fact.
