build_vqa_pairs.py

Build BATCHED qa_pairs.jsonl directly from schema.json (single source of truth).

Updated for schema v6.1 and the current image-creation scripts. Each
script emits its images plus a caption sidecar JSON, written at generation
time; every sidecar is keyed by schema.json's own "images_needed" names, so
nothing here has to translate between filename and key format:

  create_3d_renders.py    -> {case}_3d_left.png, _3d_frontal.png, _3d_right.png
                              + {case}_3d_captions.json
  create_panoramic.py     -> {case}_panoramic.png (single image, skipped
                              entirely if <4 teeth detected)
                              + {case}_panoramic_caption.json
  create_tooth_detail.py  -> {case}_tooth{fdi}_composite.png (one multi-panel
                              composite per tooth)
                              + {case}_tooth_captions.json
  create_sinus_detail.py  -> {case}_sinus_{right,left}_detail.png
                              + {case}_sinus_captions.json

Each of those is ONE multi-panel image per fact target, so every fact needs
exactly one image today.

WHICH QUESTIONS RIDE ON ONE CALL is declared explicitly in CALL_PLAN below,
not derived from which facts happen to share an image. Nine calls per case:
one per 3D view, four across the panoramic, one per sinus side. The
panoramic split is the reason the plan is explicit -- all 12 of its facts
share one image, so any image-derived grouping would merge them, whereas
dental_arch_findings_{arch} (a tooth-by-tooth survey of up to 16 teeth)
needs a response of its own per arch.

resolve_call_plan() cross-checks that table against schema.json on every
run and hard-fails on any disagreement, so a fact added to the schema and
not placed in a call is an error rather than a question silently never asked.

Output: still one record per case, with the same overall split (global /
dental_elements) as before. Each call carries an "images" dict (image_key ->
relative path), a "captions" dict (image_key -> caption text, pulled from
the sidecar JSON files) so downstream inference can pass captions to the VLM
alongside each image, and -- new in v6.1 -- a "guidance" string holding the
shared _definitions vocabulary that call's facts refer to by name.
If you don't want captions threaded through qa_pairs.jsonl (e.g. if
run_vqa_inference.py will read the sidecar files itself instead), the
--no-captions flag drops the "captions" field entirely.

A call is DROPPED if NONE of its needed images exist for the case (partial
image sets are still sent -- more images generally helps the VLM, and no
single image in a set is strictly required by the questions themselves).
dental_elements keeps its old policy: all 32 FDI keys always present, with
individual images possibly missing (skipped, not dropping the whole tooth).
What each of those keys ASKS can differ, though: a dental_elements fact may
carry an "applies_to_fdi" list narrowing it to the positions where the
question exists (tooth_{fdi}_mandible_canal, the lower molars) -- see
fact_applies_to_fdi below.

# one fact to the positions where the question exists at all:
# tooth_{fdi}_mandible_canal is asked of the lower molars (36-38, 46-48)
# only, because the mandibular canal does not run under the other 26.
#
# Gating it here rather than telling the model "answer null unless this is a
# lower molar" is the difference between 6 questions and 32: the other 26 are
# not cheap null answers, they are 26 more chances to invent a canal finding
# at a position that has no canal, and 26 fields the guided_json decoder is
# forced to emit. Every consumer that walks dental_elements per FDI asks this

# images, because which questions ride on one response is a judgment about
# the model's attention, not a property of the pictures.
#
# The panoramic is the case in point. All 12 of its facts share one image, so
# any image-derived grouping merges them; here it is deliberately cut FOUR
# ways, along what the questions are ABOUT:
#
#   pano_tooth_findings_{arch} -- everything answered POSITION BY POSITION:
#       the tooth-by-tooth survey plus implants and bridges, which are also
#       located by FDI ("position 35", "from 24 to 27") and are what occupies
#       a position the survey reads as absent. One pass over the arch answers
#       all three, and the survey's own absent positions are exactly where the
#       model should be looking for a fixture or a pontic.
#   pano_others_{arch} -- the three arch-WIDE judgments (primary dentition,
#       bone quality, periodontal resorption), which describe the arch as a
#       whole rather than any one position.

# resolve_call_plan() hard-fails if this table and schema.json disagree:
