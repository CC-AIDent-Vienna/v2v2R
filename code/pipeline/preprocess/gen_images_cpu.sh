# code/pipeline/preprocess/gen_images_cpu.sh -- steps 1-4 of the main pipeline, on the CPU partition
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# code/pipeline/aksssr_pipeline.sh holds an a100 allocation for its whole run, but only
# steps 6-8 (vLLM preflight / server / inference) actually touch the GPU.
# Steps 1-4 are nibabel + numpy + PIL + marching cubes -- ~4 min/case, so
# ~3 h of a 40-case run, all of it spent with an idle A100 attached. When the
# gpu/a100 queue is deep, that time is paid twice: once waiting in PD for a GPU
# the image generation never needed, and again generating images while holding
# one.
#
# This job does steps 1-4 ONLY, on --partition=cpu (whose queue is normally far
# shorter), writing into the SAME outputs/${RUN_NAME}_${SPLIT}/images directory
# the pipeline uses. It is not a separate arm: same four generators, same facts
# arguments, same output filenames, so the images are the ones the pipeline
# would have produced itself. Afterwards the pipeline's per-step existence
# checks all hit their [SKIP] branches and the GPU job goes essentially straight
# to step 5 -> vLLM.
#
#   sbatch code/pipeline/preprocess/gen_images_cpu.sh validate      # now, on the short cpu queue
#   sbatch code/pipeline/aksssr_pipeline.sh validate     # later; steps 1-4 skip
#
# The two can also be queued at the same time -- the pipeline re-checks each
# completion signal per case, so whatever this job has finished by then is
# skipped and the rest is generated on the GPU node as before. Nothing breaks
# if they overlap on a case; the worst case is that one case's images get
# written twice (see PARALLELISM below for the one real caveat).
#
# PARALLELISM
# -----------
# The pipeline walks cases serially. Here they are independent -- each
# generator reads only this case's volume + mask + facts and writes only this
# case's files -- so WORKERS cases run concurrently via xargs -P. WORKERS=4 on
# --cpus-per-task=8 / --mem=32G means 2 threads and ~8 GB per case, which is
# what the thread-count exports below are divided for. That turns ~3 h into
# ~45 min for a 40-case split.
#
# Raise WORKERS only together with --cpus-per-task and --mem: a CBCT volume
# plus its mask is several GB resident, and the failure mode of over-committing
# memory here is the whole job being OOM-killed, not one slow case.
#
# The one thing NOT to do is run two copies of this job over the same split and
# images dir at once. The completion signals are written at the END of each
# generator, so two workers that start the same case both see "not done" and
# race on the same PNG paths.
#
# Per-case output goes to outputs/${RUN_NAME}_${SPLIT}/imagegen_logs/<case>.log
# rather than the job log: with WORKERS>1 the generators' stdout would otherwise
# interleave into something unreadable. The job log keeps one line per case.
#
# FACTS
# -----
# Identical semantics to aksssr_pipeline.sh, because the images have to be the
# same ones:
#   default    step 1 gets --facts-file (REQUIRED -- create_panoramic.py filters
#              its outlines/tags by facts.teeth_present and hard-errors without
#              it), steps 2-3 get it optionally, step 4 never takes it. A case
#              with no facts file is skipped, not hard-failed.
#   NO_FACTS=1 step 1 takes --no-facts (every SEGMENTED tooth outlined -- this
#              changes the PIXELS, not just the caption), steps 2-3 are handed
#              no --facts-file, and the missing-facts skip is lifted.
# If you generate here with a different NO_FACTS setting than you later run the
# pipeline with, the pipeline will NOT correct it -- it skips on file existence,
# not on how the file was made. Keep the two invocations' NO_FACTS in sync.
#
# LIMIT/SEED match aksssr_pipeline.sh exactly (same seeded shuf), so LIMIT=5
# here generates images for the same 5 cases LIMIT=5 there will ask for.
#
# qa_pairs.jsonl (step 5) is built here too, but only on a full run: it is the
# real check that every image the schema asks for exists and is named right,
# and the pipeline rebuilds it in seconds anyway. Under LIMIT it is skipped
# rather than clobbering a full-split qa_pairs.jsonl with a 5-case one, it is
# skipped when no case succeeded, and it is written via a temp file that only
# moves into place once it is non-empty -- it is a COMMITTED artefact, so a
# build over an empty images dir must leave the good one alone.
#
# ENVIRONMENT: this activates cbct_base by sourcing a conda.sh found BY PATH,
# not via the `conda` command, so it works under a non-interactive submission
# (ssh host 'sbatch ...') where ~/.bashrc was never sourced and the conda shell
# function does not exist. Override the search with CONDA_BASE=/path/to/conda
# or the env name with CONDA_ENV=. Imports are preflighted once before any case
# runs, so a broken env exits in two seconds instead of failing 582 times.
