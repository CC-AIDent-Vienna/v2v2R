code/pipeline/preprocess/create_panoramic.py

Generate a standardized curved dental panoramic reconstruction (CPR) from
CBCT volume + segmentation mask.

Algorithm:
  1. Detect arch curve   — per-FDI-pair tooth centroids (or, when too few
                           teeth are present -- edentulous/sparse dentition --
                           a jawbone centerline instead) → ramus-extended,
                           fold-safe parametric cubic spline, then RESAMPLED TO
                           UNIFORM ARC LENGTH in millimetres so one output
                           column always spans the same physical distance
                           along the arch.
  2. Compute normals     — smooth finite-difference normals to prevent seam
                           artefacts caused by jumpy per-point normals.
  3. Curved slab sample  — chunked map_coordinates across positions × depths × Z,
                           at a SQUARE PHYSICAL PIXEL (same mm along the arch as
                           down Z), so the panoramic's aspect ratio is the
                           anatomy's own rather than a forced constant.
                           Slab depth is specified in mm and additionally shrunk
                           wherever the curve's own local radius of curvature is
                           tighter than the slab -- a safety margin on top of the
                           fold-proofed curve above, since an offset ray can
                           still cross even along a curve that doesn't fold on
                           itself if it bends tightly enough.
  4. MIP projection      — max-intensity along slab depth → one column per arch pt.
  5. Window/level        — the volume is first clipped at an ENAMEL CEILING
                           estimated per case from the tooth labels themselves
                           (median of the per-tooth 98th percentile, so a few
                           metal-crowned teeth cannot move it), which stops
                           metal restorations from smearing through the MIP and
                           dragging the window ceiling far above real anatomy --
                           the reason panoramics of restored cases came out
                           dark. Percentile windowing then runs over FOREGROUND
                           pixels only, followed by a mild CLAHE blend that
                           leaves near-black air untouched. Flip Z
                           superior-at-top.
  6. Overlay             — vectorised label vote, restricted to whichever FDI
                           numbers the case's facts.json declares present
                           (facts.structured.teeth_present) so a segmentation
                           false-positive can never draw an outline/tag for a
                           tooth that isn't actually there; FDI numbers at centroids.

Output geometry: the panoramic body is rendered directly at its final pixel
size (default ~900 px tall, width set by the arch's true length), so the PNG
is never an upscale of a smaller raster and the 1-3 px tooth outlines are
never resampled. Pass --canvas WxH to letterbox into a fixed canvas instead.

A facts.json is REQUIRED for every case (--facts-file / --facts-dir) -- it's
the source of truth for which teeth actually get outlined and tagged, not
just whatever the segmentation mask happens to contain.

Usage:
    python code/pipeline/preprocess/create_panoramic.py \
        --volume  dataset/validate/images/F006_0000.nii.gz \
        --mask    dataset/validate/masks/F006.nii.gz \
        --facts-file dataset/validate/facts/F006.json \
        --out-dir outputs/panoramic/

    toothless (facts.json still required -- typically declares an
    empty/near-empty teeth_present list for an edentulous case; the arch
    curve itself falls back to a jawbone-centerline seed automatically):

    Put the arch points in traversal order, right → left ALONG THE ARCH, and
    damp the radial jitter between them. Both steps work in polar coordinates
    about a centre inside the arch's concavity, and together they are what
    keeps the polyline from doubling back on itself.

    1. ORDER BY ANGLE, not by X. Sorting by X is only correct where the arch
       actually runs left-right: at the posterior ends it runs almost straight
       anterior-posteriorly, so X barely separates neighbouring molars and
       their order there is decided by a few voxels of segmentation noise.
       Two consecutive points coming out in the wrong order double the
       polyline back on itself -- a fold -- which the spline fit then has to
       reproduce. Angle follows the U-shape instead, so the traversal stays
       correct all the way round into the ramus whatever the posterior teeth's
       exact X values.

    2. SMOOTH THE RADIUS along that angular sequence. Angular order alone is
       not enough, because the points are not all measured the same way: an
       arch point is the mean of the upper and the lower tooth of one FDI
       pair, EXCEPT where only one of the two is segmented, where it is that
       single tooth's own centroid. The maxillary arch is wider than the
       mandibular one, so those single-jaw points sit systematically 10-20
       voxels off the arch the paired ones describe. A point that jumps
       outward and back in again is a fold just as much as a mis-ordered one
       (this is what put a visible loop in A019's right posterior), and it is
       measurement noise rather than anatomy. Smoothing the radius along the
       sequence removes it and leaves the arch's shape alone.

    Falls back to the plain descending-X sort, with no radial smoothing, when
    polar treatment has no well-defined centre to work from: too few points,
    or a near-straight point set (the jawbone-centerline seed can be almost
    flat), or no clear angular gap on the open side of the arch to start the

    Drop seed points that sit nowhere near the rest of the arch.

    A mis-segmented tooth label puts a centroid a long way from the dentition,
    and `detect_arch_curve` averages the upper and lower tooth of an FDI pair
    into ONE seed point -- so a single bad label drags that pair's seed to a
    meaningless midpoint between the real tooth and the bogus one. F014 is the
    worked example: label 28 covers 4266 voxels at (97, 76) while every other
    tooth in the case lies in x 170-356, y 274-412, and the 28/38 pair seeds
    the arch at (226, 180), 200+ voxels off the curve in both directions

    Nothing else in this file removes it. `_trim_fold` inspects only a few
    segments at each END, and this lands mid-sequence; `_order_arch_points`
    smooths the radius with a size-3 MEAN, which spreads a lone spike over
    three points instead of rejecting it. The fitted spline then has to travel
    out to the stray point and back, which on F014 added 110 mm to a 180 mm
    arch -- a third of the panoramic's width spent on empty space, with every
    tooth shrunk to pay for it.

    Test: a point's ISOLATION is its distance to the nearer of its two
    neighbours along the traversal (its only neighbour, at the ends). A real
    arch point always has a close neighbour, even across a gap left by a
    missing tooth -- that gap is about two tooth widths, ~2x the median step.
    `k=4` therefore sits well clear of any legitimate spacing while catching
    the pathological case, and `max_drop`/`min_keep` bound the damage if some

    On top of that, the old code chose the number of arch points as
    `z_height * target_aspect`, i.e. it forced every case's raster to a fixed

    Estimate the intensity of the brightest NATURAL tooth tissue in this
    volume, so everything above it (metal crowns, posts, implants, amalgam,
    and the streak artefacts they throw) can be clipped before projection.

    Why this is the fix for the dark panoramics
    -------------------------------------------
    The MIP takes the maximum along ~8 mm of slab depth, so a single metal
    restoration does not stay the size of the restoration: it wins the max for
    every ray that passes anywhere near it, and its streaks win over a wider
    area still. In a restored case that puts a bright population across a
    non-trivial fraction of the image -- easily more than the 0.5% that the
    old `np.percentile(arr, 99.5)` window ceiling was chosen to discard. The
    ceiling therefore landed inside the metal rather than at enamel, and
    every real structure got mapped into the bottom of the 0-255 range. That
    is the "too dark" case, and it is worst exactly on the cases with the most
    to read.

    Estimator: the MEDIAN over teeth of each tooth's own 98th percentile. A
    per-tooth peak is enamel for a natural tooth and metal for a restored one,
    and taking the median across teeth means the estimate only moves if MOST
    of the dentition is restored -- unlike a percentile pooled over all tooth
    voxels at once, which a handful of metal crowns would drag upward (metal
    is far denser than enamel, so those voxels sit at the very top of the
    pooled distribution and a few teeth's worth is enough to occupy the top
    percentile).

    The estimate is then capped against the jaw bone (see `_cap_against_bone`),
    which catches the one case a median across teeth cannot: a dentition where
    the restored teeth are the MAJORITY, so the median peak is metal itself.

    Falls back to the jaw bone's own high percentile with extra headroom when
    there are too few teeth to take a median over (edentulous cases), and to a
    plain global percentile when there is no usable segmentation at all.
    Returns None only if the volume itself is degenerate.

# absent_teeth, implants, fixed_bridges, and (implicitly) teeth_present /
# crowns among the six fields currently in scope: teeth_present,
# teeth_absent, crowns, implants, bridge, ian_close_teeth. ian_close_teeth
# maps to the 3D views instead (handled in create_3d_renders.py) -- it does
# not appear here.
#
# The caption is written at generation time (same pattern as
# create_3d_renders.py): a static description of what the image itself
# shows (grayscale CPR, color-coded tooth outlines, FDI tags, L marker),
# plus terse fragments for whichever facts are actually present. A field
# only produces a fragment when it's informative (non-empty list / truthy
# bridge); empty/false/missing fields are silently skipped, never padded
# with "none" text.
#
# CROWNS AND IMPLANTS NO LONGER PRODUCE A FRAGMENT (v7). They used to, and
# the caption then read "Crown on teeth 24 and 45. Endosseous implant in
# position 25." -- which hands the model the answer to the very questions
# the panoramic call asks it (dental_arch_findings_{arch} and
# implants_{arch}). Present/absent stays, because it is not a finding the
# schema scores: it identifies WHICH teeth the tags name, and the outlines
# themselves are already filtered by teeth_present, so the caption only
# says out loud what the pixels already show.

    -------------------
    `out_height` is the panoramic BODY height in pixels (tag bands add to it);
    it sets the physical pixel size px_mm, which is then used for BOTH the
    row spacing and the arch column spacing, so the pixel is square in
    millimetres and the image's aspect ratio is the anatomy's own.
    `slab_mm` is the slab HALF-thickness in millimetres (`slab_depth`
    overrides it with an explicit voxel count). Expressing it in mm rather
    than voxels is what makes it mean the same thing across scans acquired at
    different resolutions.
    `canvas` is an optional (w, h) to letterbox into; None writes the
    natively-rendered image with no resampling at all.
