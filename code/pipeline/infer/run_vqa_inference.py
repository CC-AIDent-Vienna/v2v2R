run_vqa_inference.py

VLM inference matching the qa_pairs.jsonl format produced by the updated
build_vqa_pairs.py (schema v6.1): each case record has

  record["global"][call_key]           = {"images": {...}, "captions": {...}, "questions": {...}}
  record["dental_elements"]["tooth_N"] = {"images": {...}, "captions": {...}, "questions": {...}}

There's no more single "global" + per-tooth "detail" call in the OLD sense
-- "global" now holds SEVERAL calls (grouped by which images they need: one
per 3D view, one sinus call per side, and the panoramic split into a
mandible half and a maxilla half; mandible and maxilla facts are pooled
together here and collapse into one call whenever they happen to need the
same image, e.g. the mandible's condyle/canal facts and the maxilla's
upper-wisdom-tooth fact all only need "3d_left"), and "dental_elements"
holds one call per tooth. Every call's images come with a caption (unless
build_vqa_pairs.py was run with --no-captions), which gets woven into the
prompt right before each image -- MedThinkVQA-style "per-image caption,
then the image".

All calls in "global" are merged into one flat prediction dict
(prediction["global"]) since their facts are logically part of the same
whole-case picture -- and because the panoramic call's
dental_arch_findings_{arch} is what WOULD gate which teeth get a detail call
(see model_absent_teeth), which needs the merged view to be readable. That
gate is off (TRUST_MODEL_ABSENCE = False), and its being off is what makes
every call in a case independent of every other, so they are all issued
concurrently -- see run_calls_concurrently().

Reads qa_pairs.jsonl (one record per case), calls vLLM via the
OpenAI-compatible chat completions API, writes one {case_id}_pred.json
per case.

    two-turn [system, user] shape cannot -- a multi-turn layout
    [system, ex_user, ex_assistant, ..., query_user], for instance. The
    pipeline itself still goes through call_vllm() below and is unaffected:
    same retry, same structured decoding, same reasoning_content fallback,
    same Optional[str] return.

    json_schema (from qa_pairs.jsonl, built by build_vqa_pairs.py) CONSTRAINS
    the sampler to the declared shape. Without it the schema is prompt-only,
    and the model sometimes answers an object-typed field with a string

    valid JSON, wrong shape, which then breaks postprocessing downstream. It
    constrains only the generated turn, so any answers already present in the

    IT IS SENT AS `response_format`, NOT `guided_json`, AND THAT IS A FIX.
    vLLM's request models are pydantic `extra="allow"`, so an unknown key in
    extra_body is accepted, logged nowhere the pipeline reads, and dropped.
    `guided_json` was deprecated in vLLM 0.11 (forwarded to
    `structured_outputs`) and REMOVED by 0.22 -- which is the version inside
    extraction.sqsh. So every run in this repo that thought it was decoding
    under a grammar was in fact prompt-only, silently, and normalize_pred.py
    has been repairing shape violations that the sampler should never have
    been able to emit. `response_format` is the OpenAI-standard spelling,
    is a first-class client parameter rather than an extra_body key, and is
    understood by every vLLM in play (0.11 -> 0.22, and 0.19.0 in the
    submission container); the client validates its shape locally and the
    server 400s on a schema its grammar backend cannot compile, so this

# Shared "how to read a tooth" block, injected into every call that judges
# per-tooth findings (the per-tooth detail calls and the panoramic tooth
# survey; NOT the 3D/sinus calls, which ask nothing about tooth structure).
#
# It exists because the two commonest VLM errors on this task are the same
# mistake -- reading a gray level without reading WHERE it sits:
#   • enamel (bright by nature) read as a crown/restoration
#   • the root canal (dark by nature) read as caries
# Neither is settled by brightness ALONE. The block therefore states the
# normal structure first and then gives the discriminator for each pair, and
# every discriminator reads brightness together with shape and position --
# brightness is a real cue (metal streaks and is far brighter than enamel),
# it is just never a threshold on its own, since tooth-coloured restoratives
# are made to match enamel's radiopacity and land in the same gray range.
# "Brighter than enamel -> it is a restoration" was the earlier wording and it
# silently missed every composite and ceramic restoration; the opposite
# overcorrection -- ignore brightness, read shape only -- throws away the one
# cue that does settle metal. Keep it short: ~34 calls per case.

HOW TO READ A TOOTH
────────────────────
Normal structure -- none of this is a finding on its own:
- ENAMEL: the bright cap over the CROWN only. It is the densest tissue in the
  body, so a healthy crown is ALREADY the brightest part of the tooth.
- DENTIN: the mid-gray bulk beneath the enamel, continuing into the root.
- PULP CHAMBER / ROOT CANAL: the DARK line down the CENTRE of the tooth, from
  the crown to each root apex.

A BRIGHT area can be enamel or restorative material, and a DARK one can be the
normal root canal or a defect. Tell them apart by brightness, SHAPE and
POSITION together:

Enamel or restoration?
- Enamel: caps the crown only, thins away smoothly at the neck, follows the
  cusp shape, and the dark canal still shows through beneath it.
- Restoration: geometry a tooth does not have -- a uniform shell or block
  with a SHARP, straight margin against tooth substance, a flat floor, or a
  cavity outline; it hides/replaces the structure beneath it, and metal
  streaks. A crown covers the whole clinical crown down to a defined neck
  margin.
- Bright but tooth-shaped, tapering at the neck, canal visible under it
  -> ENAMEL, report no restoration.

Canal or defect?
- Canal (normal): dark, thin, CENTRAL, smooth-walled, continuous from the
  pulp chamber to the apex, and similar in each root of the same tooth.
- A BRIGHT line following that same central path -> root canal filling (RCT).
- Defect: dark that is WIDER than the canal, ragged or asymmetric between
  roots of one tooth, breaking the tooth's outline, or reaching the OUTER
  surface -- occlusal, proximal contact point, cervical -- eating inward.
- Thin, central, symmetric = anatomy. Wide, ragged, off-centre or open to the
  surface = defect (caries, resorption, fracture).

Also:
- Crown above bone -> fully erupted; partly below -> partially erupted/impacted
- Linear shadow along the root -> fracture
- Dark halo at the apex -> periapical lesion

HOW_TO_READ_THE_PANORAMIC = """\
HOW TO READ THE PANORAMIC
──────────────────────────
SCALE FIRST. This is the whole arch flattened into one image, so a single tooth
is a few dozen pixels wide -- roughly a fortieth of the detail the per-tooth
crops carry. Report only what is unmistakable AT THIS SCALE. A feature you have
to zoom into, or reason your way to, is not a finding here.

WHAT THIS IMAGE CAN SETTLE
- Whether a tooth is there at all, and roughly where the bone crest sits.
- Material INSIDE the canal: a thin bright line running the length of the canal
  toward the apex, or a THICK, SHORT bright rod in its upper part that stops
  well above the apex (see _definitions.root_canal_fill).
- Material ON the crown: a sharply-bordered opacity clearly brighter than the
  enamel of its neighbours, with a straight or geometric edge no tooth has.
- Gross loss of tooth substance: a dark notch that breaks the crown's outline
  and eats inward from the outer surface, or a root left with no crown at all.
- A third molar's tipping and how much of its crown is still under bone.

WHAT IT CANNOT SETTLE -- and the enum does not ask you to
- WHICH restoration it is. A full crown, a large filling and a bridge abutment
  retainer are one bright capped tooth at this scale, so they share the single
  value "restoration"; the per-tooth crops separate them.
- A post from a root canal filling. Both are material in the canal and both
  read "root_canal_treatment" here, for the same reason.
- Caries from a broken-down root remnant. Both are lost tooth substance and
  both read "defect".
- Early or small caries, hairline root fractures, fine periapical detail.

- CERVICAL BURNOUT: a dark wedge at the neck, between the crown's enamel and
  the root, caused by the beam passing through less tissue there. It appears on
  MANY teeth at once and sits at the same level on each. Cervical caries is a
  break in ONE tooth's outline; a dark band shared by a run of neighbouring
  teeth is burnout.
- GHOST SHADOWS: a blurred, magnified copy of a dense structure from the
  OPPOSITE side, projected across the image and usually higher than the real
  one. Common over the rami and the midline.
- SUPERIMPOSITION: the spine in the midline, the hard palate over the upper
  roots, and the opposite arch over the rami, all darkening or brightening
  areas that belong to no tooth.
- REFORMAT SMEAR: the curve is fitted to the arch, so a tooth outside it is
  stretched, thinned or duplicated. Sharp horizontal density steps mark where
  the curve left the anatomy.

# image's 768 visual tokens, against 1764 for the single tooth in a composite
# -- so that block was spending 533 tokens arguing for a level of scrutiny the
# pixels cannot support, and inviting exactly the over-claiming the survey
# shows (panoramic-source precision 0.16-0.25). The panoramic block below
# instead states what this image can and cannot settle, and names the four

# ── What the model is actually being shown ────────────────────────────────
#
# One intro per CALL, built from that call's own images_needed names, because
# the four image kinds are not the same kind of picture and the old single
# wording was wrong for three of them. It claimed:
#
#   "You are given N CBCT image(s) ... Read each caption before its image, and
#    use all the images together to answer."
#
#   - "CBCT image" is right only for the sinus grids and the tooth composites,
#     which really are grayscale slices out of the volume. A 3D render is a
#     SURFACE MODEL of the segmentation masks -- no grayscale, no slice, and
#     nothing in it to window or measure density on. The panoramic is a curved
#     reformat of the volume, closer to a rendering than to a slice.
#   - "use all the images together" was addressed to a model holding exactly
#     ONE image: every fact in the current schema needs one image, so that
#     sentence asked it to combine a set of size 1 for every global call, and
#     "up to 1 CBCT images ... axial, coronal and sagittal slices" told the
#     per-tooth call it had three when it has one composite carrying nine
#     panels.
#
# FDI TAGS ARE LIKEWISE NOT UNIVERSAL. The panoramic prints an FDI tag per
# tooth in the tooth's own colour, and so do the sinus details; the 3D renders
# print no tags at all (their colour key is per STRUCTURE -- mandible green,
# canal yellow), and the tooth composite has one target outlined in red, the
# mandibular canal filled with a translucent wash of that same yellow on lower
# teeth, and its FDI in the title bar. Telling a 3D call to "match the tag to its tooth by
# COLOUR" names a marker that is not in the picture, which is the same failure
# mode as a caption describing an outline that is not drawn.

# ── Batched calling ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every call in a case is an independent request against the same server, but
# they used to be issued one at a time, one in flight, so vLLM's continuous
# batching had nothing to batch and the GPU idled between requests. Measured on
# the 40-case v6.9 validate run (logs/aksssr_v6_553351.log): 1092 calls, 2h34m
# of inference, 4.0 min/case, of which 781 tooth calls at 9.5 s each accounted
# for 80.5% of the time.
#
# What makes it safe to issue ALL of a case's calls together -- global and
# per-tooth -- rather than only the tooth ones is TRUST_MODEL_ABSENCE being off.
# The only thing a tooth call ever needed from the global calls is
# model_absent_teeth(), and with the flag off that set cannot cancel a tooth
# call: the segmentation that produced the composite wins, so `to_process` is
# just "every tooth with an image", which is known from qa_pairs.jsonl before
# any request is sent. Turn TRUST_MODEL_ABSENCE on and the dependency comes
# back, so the code below keeps the barrier for that case rather than assuming
# it away -- two batched phases instead of one.
