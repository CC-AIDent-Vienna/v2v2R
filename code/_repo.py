"""Where the repo root is, and where the code groups are.

Every module under code/ is flat-imported by name -- `import postprocess_pred`,
not `from pipeline.postprocess import postprocess_pred`. That is on purpose: it
keeps `python3 code/<group>/<module>.py` working as a plain script invocation,
which is how every job script and every doc example calls this code, and it
means the grouping can be rearranged without touching a single import.

The cost is that sys.path has to be told where the groups are, which is what
add_code_paths() does. Call it once, at the top of any module that imports a
sibling.

REPO_ROOT is resolved from this file's own location rather than counted in
`.parent.parent` hops, and module_path() searches the groups rather than
assuming a flat directory. Both replace idioms that failed SILENTLY when the
tree was reorganised: a default path one directory too shallow, and a
subprocess path to a script that had moved.
