# All the orchestration is in code/pipeline/infer.py. This file is the SLURM directives,
# the pyxis invocation and the environment -- the three things a Python entry
# point genuinely cannot do for itself. If you are looking for what the pipeline
# DOES, read infer.py; if you are looking for where it runs, read this.
#
# WHY THE STAGES EXIST, WHICH IS NOT MODULARITY
# ---------------------------------------------
# They want different hardware, and the difference is expensive:
#
#   images   Four generators per case, all CPU. On the gpu partition this holds
#            an a100 for ~50 minutes over 40 cases while never touching it.
#            gen_images_cpu.sh existed for exactly this reason and is folded in
#            here: a batch run holds its allocation from the first case to the
#            last, so the rendering half belongs on the cpu partition where the
#            queue is short and the card is not idle.
#
#   infer    vLLM + the VLM calls. The only stage that needs a GPU, and the only
#            one that must run INSIDE the container -- vLLM is not installed on
#            the host. Folded in from pool_infer.sh.
#
#   post     postprocess_pred.py -> synthesize_report.py -> the fact survey.
#            No GPU, no model, so it runs on the login node in seconds per case.
#            This is the postprocess_now.sh tuning loop, and it is the reason
#            that loop was worth having: a flag change is re-measured without a
#            queue wait. Folded in from postprocess_now.sh.
#
# STAGE=all is the single-case path. Splitting one case into three queue waits
# would cost more than it saves, and infer.py already overlaps the vLLM load
# against the rendering, which is the whole trick that makes one case fast.
#
# DO NOT RUN TWO COPIES OVER THE SAME OUT_DIR
# -------------------------------------------
# Inherited from gen_images_cpu.sh and still true. The per-generator completion
# signal is written at the END of each generator, so two workers that start the
# same case both see "not done" and race on the same PNG paths.
#
# WHAT --gt-dir DOES, AND WHY IT IS OPTIONAL
# ------------------------------------------
# It turns on the fact-level survey at the end of STAGE=post, written to
# <out>/survey/survey_facts_<stamp>.{txt,json} and never overwritten, so
# successive runs diff against each other. That diff is how a postprocess flag
# change is read -- `git diff` cannot show it, because outputs/ is gitignored.
# Without it the summaries and reports are still built and only the measurement
# is skipped; a missing ground truth is not a pipeline failure.
#
# THE SOURCE RULES ARE ON BY DEFAULT, AND SILENT WHEN THEY ARE NOT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# infer.py passes --facts-dir to postprocess_pred.py whenever audited facts are
# present, which is what turns on the ten source rules worth +0.06 official. In
# STAGE=post the facts come from <out>/facts, written by STAGE=images. Run post
# against an out-dir that never had an images stage and the rules are OFF and
# the summaries are the pre-2026-08-16 shape -- infer.py warns, because nothing
# else about the output says so. NO_FACTS=1 is the deliberate ablation.
#
# THE ARM IS A CONFIG FILE -- POSTPROCESS_CONFIG
# ----------------------------------------------
# Which source rules, cross-source gates and FOV policies run is
# configs/postprocess/<arm>.yaml, not a constant edited in postprocess_pred.py
# and not a flag added here. Unset, infer.py uses configs/postprocess/default.yaml
# -- the arm-6 settings, identical to what the code carries as constants, so
# the default costs nothing and every summary gains a `postprocess_config`
# stamp naming the arm that built it.
#
#   STAGE=post POSTPROCESS_CONFIG=configs/postprocess/no_source_rules.yaml \
#       scripts/run_infer.sh validate
#
# An experiment is a new file in configs/postprocess/ and one line here. It is
# NOT a code edit -- that is the whole point of the split, and it is what makes
# the survey diff between two runs attributable to a named arm rather than to
# whatever the working tree happened to contain when the job was scheduled.
#
# The config and NO_FACTS=1 are DIFFERENT ablations. NO_FACTS drops
# --facts-dir, which also takes away the maxilla-FOV override; a config with
# the eleven rules off keeps the facts file and isolates the rules alone.
# configs/postprocess/no_source_rules.yaml says so in its own header.
