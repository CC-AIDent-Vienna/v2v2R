# scripts/run_eval.sh -- score a run: the official ranking, and the fact-level
# survey underneath it.
#
#   scripts/run_eval.sh outputs/aksssr_v7_trained_arm6_validate
#   STAGE=survey    scripts/run_eval.sh <run_dir>       # no judge needed
#   NO_RADFACT=1    scripts/run_eval.sh <run_dir>       # BLEU/METEOR only
#   ARM_DIR=outputs/training_results/vsft_arm5 SPLIT=training \
#                   scripts/run_eval.sh <run_dir>       # three surveys
#
# NO #SBATCH, ON PURPOSE. This runs on the LOGIN NODE.
# ----------------------------------------------------
# The RadFact judge is a separate, long-lived job:
#
#   sbatch --partition=gpu --qos=a100 --gres=gpu:a100:1 scripts/judge_server.sh
#   tail -f logs/judge_server_*.log        # wait for "[PASS] Judge ready"
#   scripts/run_eval.sh <run_dir>          # as often as you like
#   scancel -n judge                       # it does NOT stop before --time
#
# That split is the point. judge_server.sh holds the model on a GPU node and
# advertises itself in .judge/{url,ready,jobid}; this script finds it and pays
# no model load. Folding them into one job is what scripts/evaluation.sh did,
# and it reloaded a 14B model on every evaluation -- 15 to 25 minutes to score
# a run that takes seconds. eval.py discovers the judge in this order:
# --judge-url, then .judge/url, then `squeue -n judge`.
#
# ARGUMENT ORDER CHANGED FROM eval_now.sh
# ---------------------------------------
#   was:  scripts/eval_now.sh <training|validate> [synthesized_reports_dir]
#   now:  scripts/run_eval.sh <run_dir> [training|validate]
# One RUN dir, because both halves read the same run -- the ranking scores
# <run_dir>/synthesized_reports, the survey reads <run_dir>/predictions and
# summaries. Passing a reports dir and a split separately made it possible to
# score one arm's reports against another arm's ground truth.
#
# WHY $PYTHON IS NOT JUST python3
# -------------------------------
# official_ranking.py needs nltk + radfact_lite, which live in cbct_base and
# not in the system python. eval.py invokes its two modules with
# sys.executable, so whichever interpreter starts it is the one they inherit --
# which is why picking it here is enough, and why the nltk preflight in eval.py
# is checking the interpreter that will actually do the work.
#
# The wordnet corpus is checked too, and it is the subtler of the two: nltk
# installs no corpora, a missing wordnet is not an error, and METEOR silently
# changes implementation AND SCALE on 10% of the Final Score. eval.py says so
# before a RadFact run that takes hours, while the fix is still cheap.
