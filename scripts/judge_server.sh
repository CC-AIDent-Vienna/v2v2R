#!/usr/bin/env bash
# =============================================================================
# judge_server.sh — a PERSISTENT RadFact judge (text-only Qwen3-14B on vLLM).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# scripts/evaluation.sh with JUDGE_BACKEND=vllm starts its own vLLM, evaluates,
# then kills it -- so every evaluation pays the 15-25 min model load. This
# script does ONLY the serving half. Start it once, then run
# scripts/eval_now.sh as many times as you like against it; each run costs just
# the RadFact calls.
#
# THE ONE THING THAT TRIPS PEOPLE UP
# -----------------------------------
# The server runs on a GPU COMPUTE node (s0-n0x), not on the login node where
# you run the evaluation. So http://localhost:8001 will NOT reach it -- the
# client has to use this node's hostname. That is exactly what
# scripts/eval_now.sh resolves for you, and this script prints the ready-to-paste
# URL into its log.
#
# Usage:
#   sbatch --partition=gpu --qos=a100 --gres=gpu:a100:1 scripts/judge_server.sh
#
#   # then, from the login node, any number of times:
#   scripts/eval_now.sh validate outputs/<arm>/synthesized_reports
#
#   # when finished (it does NOT stop by itself before --time):
#   scancel -n judge
#
# Runs for 8 hours, then exits and releases the GPU. Raise --time if you want
# longer, but do not leave a GPU parked on a shared cluster unattended -- the
# gpu partition has no time limit of its own, so this cap is the only thing
# stopping it.
