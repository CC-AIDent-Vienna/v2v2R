# file is the SLURM directives, the conda activation and the container path.
#
# PASS ONE OF THESE, OR THE RESULT IS UNUSABLE FOR 26 OF 40 VALIDATE CASES
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   FIRST_REPORT_ONLY=1   one report per case, the lowest-numbered radiologist
#   CONSENSUS=1           merge every radiologist of a case, field by field
#
# structured_findings_evaluation.py looks up exactly one file per case,
# {case}_gt.json. With neither flag, a multi-report case writes only
# {case}_{radiologist}_gt.json -- so that case is skipped with NO ERROR and the
# run reports a plausible score over a subset. gen_gt.py counts both filename
# shapes when it finishes and warns by name, but the flag is the fix.
#
# The two are mutually exclusive: consensus needs every radiologist's report.
#
# TWO STAGES, AND ONLY THE FIRST WANTS THIS JOB'S GPU
# ---------------------------------------------------
#   STAGE=all     (default) LLM extraction -> *_report_facts.json, then the
#                 deterministic derivation -> *_gt.json. Needs the server.
#   STAGE=derive  the second half alone, from report_facts already on disk.
#                 Pure CPU, so run it on the login node -- which is what makes
#                 a change to the deterministic half cheap to test. Verified
#                 to reproduce dataset/validate's live *_gt.json byte for byte.
#
# WHY THE PORT DEFAULT IS 8011 AND NOT 8001
# -----------------------------------------
# scripts/judge_server.sh defaults to 8001 and takes --qos=a100 too, so it can
# hold the same node. vLLM binds with SO_REUSEPORT, so a second server does NOT
# fail with "address already in use" -- both bind and the kernel round-robins
# between them. The judge serves `qwen3-14b-text` and this job asks for
# `qwen3-text`, so about half of every extraction call 404s: see
# logs/gen_gt_549316.log (342 x 200) against logs/judge_server_549303.log
# (379 x 404) at the same timestamps. gen_gt.py scans for a free port, waits on
# /v1/models rather than /health, and then probes eight times before trusting
# it. PORT= overrides the start of the scan.
